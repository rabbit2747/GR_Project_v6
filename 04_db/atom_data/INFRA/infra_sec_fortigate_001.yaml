definition:
  what: >-
    FortiGate is Fortinet's next-generation firewall (NGFW) platform running FortiOS, providing
    unified threat management including firewall, IPS, antivirus, web filtering, SSL inspection,
    SD-WAN, and VPN capabilities. Available as physical appliances (FortiGate 40F through 7000
    series), virtual machines (FortiGate-VM), and cloud instances. FortiGate is the central
    enforcement point in the Fortinet Security Fabric ecosystem.
  why: >-
    FortiGate firewalls are among the most widely deployed network security appliances globally.
    FortiOS has had numerous critical vulnerabilities actively exploited by APT groups and
    ransomware operators, including CVE-2024-21762 (out-of-band write in SSL VPN), CVE-2023-27997
    (heap buffer overflow in SSL VPN), CVE-2022-42475 (heap-based buffer overflow), and
    CVE-2018-13379 (path traversal for credential theft). These vulnerabilities have been
    exploited by Chinese and Iranian APT groups for initial network access.
  how: >-
    FortiGate inspects network traffic using custom ASIC processors (NP and CP chips) for
    hardware-accelerated packet processing. FortiOS provides stateful firewall, application
    control via App-ID, SSL/TLS deep inspection, IPS with FortiGuard signature updates,
    antivirus scanning, URL filtering, DNS filtering, and SD-WAN path selection. Management
    through FortiManager for centralized policy, FortiAnalyzer for logging and analytics.
    Integration with FortiWeb, FortiMail, FortiSandbox, and FortiClient via Security Fabric.

    FortiGate is Fortinet's NGFW platform running FortiOS with ASIC-accelerated packet processing.
    Provides firewall, IPS, antivirus, SSL inspection, SD-WAN, and VPN. Available as appliances,
    VMs, and cloud instances. Central to Fortinet Security Fabric ecosystem integrating FortiWeb,
    FortiMail, and FortiSandbox. FortiOS has had critical vulnerabilities actively exploited by
    APT groups including CVE-2024-21762 and CVE-2023-27997 in SSL VPN, enabling unauthenticated
    remote code execution and credential theft. Managed via FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer.
