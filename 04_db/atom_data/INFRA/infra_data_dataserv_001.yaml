definition:
  what: >-
    A Database Server is a dedicated computing system (physical or virtual) that hosts one or
    more database management system (DBMS) instances and provides data storage, retrieval, and
    management services to client applications over a network. Database servers run database
    engine software such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, or MongoDB,
    and are optimized for I/O throughput, memory capacity, and CPU performance to handle
    concurrent query workloads. They listen on well-known network ports (MySQL 3306, PostgreSQL
    5432, MSSQL 1433, Oracle 1521, MongoDB 27017) for client connections.
  why: >-
    Database servers are among the most valuable targets in any network because they centralize
    access to an organization's data assets. Compromise of a database server can result in
    massive data breaches, data manipulation, ransomware encryption of critical data, or
    complete business disruption. Database servers require careful hardening including network
    isolation, strong authentication, encryption at rest and in transit, regular patching,
    audit logging, and backup strategies. They are targeted through SQL injection, credential
    attacks, privilege escalation, and exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities.
  how: >-
    Database servers operate by running DBMS software that manages data files, buffer pools,
    query parsers, optimizers, and execution engines. Client connections are authenticated
    through database-native authentication or integrated authentication (Kerberos, LDAP).
    The server processes SQL or NoSQL queries, manages transactions with ACID properties,
    enforces access controls through grants and roles, and maintains data integrity through
    constraints. Storage is managed through tablespaces or data directories on local or
    SAN-attached storage. Replication, clustering, and failover mechanisms provide high
    availability. Backup and recovery procedures protect against data loss.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Network Port Exposure"
      value: >-
        Database servers listen on well-known ports that are commonly scanned and targeted
        by attackers. Network segmentation and firewall rules should restrict access to
        authorized application servers and administrators only.
    - key: "Database Authentication"
      value: >-
        Authentication mechanisms include native database accounts, integrated Windows/Kerberos
        authentication, LDAP integration, and certificate-based authentication, each with
        different security characteristics.
    - key: "Data-at-Rest Encryption"
      value: >-
        Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and column-level encryption protect stored data
        from unauthorized access at the storage layer, mitigating risks from physical media
        theft or unauthorized file system access.
    - key: "Audit Logging"
      value: >-
        Database audit logging records authentication attempts, query execution, schema changes,
        and privilege modifications, providing forensic evidence and compliance documentation.

    manipulation, ransomware, or business disruption. Security requires network isolation, strong
    authentication (native, Kerberos, LDAP), encryption at rest (TDE) and in transit (TLS),
    regular patching, audit logging, and backup strategies. Database servers process queries,
    manage ACID transactions, enforce role-based access controls, and maintain data integrity.
    Common attack vectors include SQL injection, credential attacks, privilege escalation, and
    exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities.
