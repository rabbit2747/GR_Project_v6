  what: >-
    Microsoft Azure is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offering 200+ services
    including compute (Virtual Machines, AKS, Azure Functions, App Service), storage (Blob
    Storage, Azure Files, Managed Disks), networking (Virtual Network, Load Balancer, Front
    Door, ExpressRoute), identity (Azure AD/Entra ID), and security services (Microsoft
    Defender for Cloud, Sentinel SIEM, Key Vault). Azure operates across 60+ regions with
    deep integration into the Microsoft ecosystem (Microsoft 365, Active Directory).
  why: >-
    Azure's deep integration with Active Directory and Microsoft 365 makes it a prime target
    for attackers leveraging compromised on-premises AD to pivot into cloud resources (hybrid
    identity attacks). Attack vectors include Azure AD/Entra ID misconfiguration, managed
    identity abuse, storage account key exposure, overly permissive RBAC, Service Principal
    credential theft, and cross-tenant attacks. The SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange
    breaches demonstrated sophisticated Azure-targeting campaigns.
  how: >-
    Azure uses Azure Resource Manager (ARM) for resource deployment with subscription and
    resource group organization. Identity management centers on Azure AD/Entra ID with
    Conditional Access policies, Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and managed identities.
    Network security uses Network Security Groups, Azure Firewall, and Private Link. Microsoft
    Defender for Cloud provides CSPM and CWP. Microsoft Sentinel provides cloud-native SIEM
    and SOAR. Azure Policy enforces compliance. Key Vault manages secrets, keys, and
    certificates. Azure Lighthouse enables cross-tenant management.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Hybrid Identity and AD Integration"
      value: "Deep integration with on-premises Active Directory creates hybrid identity attack paths where on-prem compromise leads to cloud takeover"
    - key: "Managed Identity"
      value: "Azure-managed identities eliminate credential management for service-to-service authentication; misconfigured managed identities enable privilege escalation"
    - key: "Microsoft Defender for Cloud"
      value: "Unified CSPM and CWP platform providing security posture management, vulnerability assessment, and workload protection across Azure and multi-cloud"
