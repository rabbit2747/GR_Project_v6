# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Slim Browser (SlimBrowser) is a lightweight web browser developed by FlashPeak that uses
    the Trident (Internet Explorer) rendering engine on Windows. It provides features including
    built-in ad blocker, form filler, download manager, translation tools, and customizable
    toolbar. As a Trident-based browser, it shares the Internet Explorer rendering engine
    and its associated security characteristics while adding convenience features.
  why: >-
    Slim Browser inherits all vulnerabilities associated with the Trident/MSHTML rendering
    engine, including ActiveX-related exploits, script injection attacks, and memory corruption
    flaws. The browser's reliance on the legacy IE engine means it lacks modern security
    features like process isolation and strict Content Security Policy enforcement found in
    Chromium-based browsers. Its built-in form filler stores credentials that could be targeted
    by credential harvesting malware. As a less common browser, it may receive less security
    scrutiny and slower vulnerability patching compared to major browsers.
  how: >-
    Slim Browser operates as a Windows application wrapping the Trident rendering engine with
    a custom user interface and additional features. It processes web content through the same
    MSHTML engine used by Internet Explorer, supporting ActiveX controls, VBScript, and legacy
    web technologies. The built-in form filler stores credentials in local storage accessible
    to the browser process. Extensions and plugins are loaded within the browser process context.
    The download manager handles file downloads with configurable security settings.

  embedding_text: >-
    Slim Browser is a lightweight Windows web browser by FlashPeak using the Trident (Internet
    Explorer) rendering engine. It provides built-in ad blocking, form filling, and download
    management. Security concerns include inheritance of all Trident/MSHTML vulnerabilities
    (ActiveX exploits, memory corruption), credential storage in local form filler accessible
    to malware, and lack of modern browser security features like process isolation and
    sandboxing. The browser supports legacy web technologies including ActiveX and VBScript.
    Security teams should discourage use of Trident-based browsers, migrate to modern
    Chromium-based alternatives, and monitor for credential theft targeting Slim Browser's
    stored passwords.
