definition:
  what: "Router Hosting refers to the network infrastructure comprising routers that provide packet forwarding, routing protocol processing, and network segmentation services. This encompasses the physical and virtual router platforms from vendors such as Cisco, Juniper, Arista, MikroTik, and Palo Alto that host routing tables, implement routing protocols (BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, IS-IS), perform packet filtering through access control lists (ACLs), provide network address translation (NAT), support quality of service (QoS) policies, and serve as the backbone interconnecting network segments, sites, and service providers. Router hosting includes edge routers at WAN boundaries, core routers in the network backbone, distribution routers aggregating access layer traffic, and virtual routers in cloud and SDN environments."
  why: "Router hosting infrastructure is the foundational layer that enables all network communication by determining how packets traverse between network segments, sites, and the internet. Routers enforce network segmentation boundaries, implement access control policies, and determine traffic paths. From a security perspective, routers are high-value targets because compromising a router provides visibility into all traffic passing through it, enables traffic manipulation and man-in-the-middle attacks, allows route injection to redirect traffic, and can be used to bypass downstream security controls. Router configuration hardening, firmware management, and monitoring are essential security operations."
  how: "Routers receive packets on ingress interfaces, consult their routing tables to determine the next-hop destination, apply ACL rules and QoS policies, and forward packets out the appropriate egress interface. Routing tables are populated through static route configuration or dynamic routing protocols that exchange reachability information with neighboring routers. BGP manages inter-autonomous-system routing for internet connectivity, while OSPF and EIGRP handle internal routing within organizations. Management access is provided through console ports, SSH, SNMP, and web interfaces. Router hardening includes disabling unnecessary services, configuring strong authentication, implementing control plane policing, enabling logging to SIEM platforms, and maintaining current firmware. Virtual routing instances (VRFs) provide logical segmentation within a single physical router."
