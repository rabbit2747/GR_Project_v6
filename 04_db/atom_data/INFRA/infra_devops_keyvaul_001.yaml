definition:
  what: "Key Vault is the general infrastructure category for managed services that securely store, manage, and control access to cryptographic keys, secrets (passwords, API keys, connection strings), and certificates. This includes AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud KMS, HashiCorp Vault, and CyberArk. Key vaults provide hardware security module (HSM) backing, access auditing, automated rotation, and integration with application and infrastructure services."
  why: "Key vaults are among the most security-critical infrastructure components because they protect the cryptographic material and credentials that safeguard all other data and systems. Compromise of a key vault effectively compromises all systems and data protected by its contents. Key vaults prevent secret sprawl by centralizing credential management, eliminating hardcoded secrets in code and configuration files. Regulatory frameworks universally require key management controls for protecting sensitive data."
  how: "Key vaults operate through authenticated API calls with fine-grained access control policies. Cryptographic keys are generated and stored within HSMs and never leave the vault boundary in plaintext. Secrets are encrypted at rest and decrypted only during authorized access. Automated rotation policies periodically generate new key material while maintaining backward compatibility. Audit logging captures all access and management operations. Integration with identity providers enables application-to-vault authentication without static credentials. Certificate lifecycle management automates issuance, renewal, and revocation."
  core_concepts:

      value: "Centralized storage and controlled access to sensitive credentials including passwords, API keys, tokens, and connection strings"
    - key: "HSM-Backed Key Storage"
      value: "Hardware security modules providing tamper-resistant storage and cryptographic operations for key material that never leaves the HSM boundary"
    - key: "Automated Key Rotation"
      value: "Periodic generation of new cryptographic material with seamless transition, maintaining backward compatibility for decryption"
    - key: "Zero-Trust Secret Access"
      value: "Authentication and authorization required for every secret access, with full audit trail and no implicit trust"
