definition:
  what: "A dialup modem is a hardware device that modulates digital signals into analog signals for transmission over Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) lines and demodulates received analog signals back to digital data. Dialup modems operate at speeds up to 56 Kbps using V.90/V.92 standards and provide point-to-point connectivity between two endpoints over traditional telephone infrastructure. Despite being largely superseded by broadband technologies, dialup modems remain present in legacy industrial control systems, out-of-band management interfaces, point-of-sale terminals, fax gateways, and remote access servers, particularly in environments where broadband connectivity is unavailable or where PSTN connectivity serves as a backup communication channel."
  why: "Dialup modems represent a significant security concern in modern networks because they provide network connectivity that often bypasses perimeter security controls such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. War dialing, the practice of systematically calling telephone numbers to discover active modems, remains a relevant reconnaissance technique. Many legacy modems lack modern authentication mechanisms and encryption, making them attractive targets for unauthorized access. In industrial and critical infrastructure environments, dialup modems connected to SCADA systems and out-of-band management ports create hidden entry points that may go unmonitored."
  how: "A dialup modem connects to a telephone line and establishes a circuit-switched connection by dialing the remote endpoint telephone number. The modems negotiate connection speed through a handshake protocol, establish synchronization, and begin data transmission using frequency modulation techniques. In server configurations, modems operate in auto-answer mode listening for incoming calls. Remote Access Service (RAS) or terminal server software manages authentication and session control. Data is transmitted as modulated analog signals over the PSTN and demodulated at the receiving end. Error correction protocols such as V.42 and data compression protocols such as V.42bis improve reliability and effective throughput."
