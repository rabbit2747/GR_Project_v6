definition:
  what: >-
    Containerd is an industry-standard container runtime that manages the complete container
    lifecycle on a host system including image transfer and storage, container execution and
    supervision, low-level storage, and network attachments. Originally developed as a component
    of Docker, containerd was extracted as a standalone daemon and donated to the CNCF. It serves
    as the default container runtime for Kubernetes since the deprecation of dockershim.
  why: >-
    Containerd is the most widely deployed container runtime in production Kubernetes clusters,
    making it a critical infrastructure component. Vulnerabilities in containerd can lead to
    container escapes, host compromise, and cluster-wide breaches. Securing containerd involves
    restricting its socket access, enabling runtime security profiles (AppArmor, seccomp), and
    keeping it patched against known CVEs including container escape vulnerabilities.
  how: >-
    Containerd runs as a daemon exposing a gRPC API over a Unix domain socket. It uses runc
    (or alternative OCI runtimes) as the low-level runtime for creating containers. The CRI
    plugin enables Kubernetes kubelet to communicate with containerd. Images are pulled from
    registries, stored as content-addressable objects, and unpacked into snapshots. Container
    lifecycle operations are managed through the API. Configuration is via
    /etc/containerd/config.toml.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "CRI Implementation"
      value: "Implements the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface, serving as the bridge between kubelet and low-level container operations"
    - key: "OCI Runtime Delegation"
      value: "Delegates actual container creation to OCI-compliant runtimes like runc while managing image, snapshot, and lifecycle operations"
    - key: "Content-Addressable Storage"
      value: "Stores container images as content-addressable objects with snapshot-based filesystem management for efficient storage"

    Containerd is an industry-standard container runtime managing the complete container lifecycle
    including image transfer, container execution, storage, and network attachments. Originally
    from Docker, it is now a CNCF project and the default Kubernetes container runtime via the
    CRI plugin. Containerd runs as a daemon exposing a gRPC API, delegates to runc for container
    creation, and stores images as content-addressable objects. Security concerns include container
    escape vulnerabilities, socket access restriction, and runtime security profiles (AppArmor,
    seccomp). Configuration is managed via /etc/containerd/config.toml.
