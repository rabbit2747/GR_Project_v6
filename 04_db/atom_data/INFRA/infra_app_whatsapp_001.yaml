definition:
  what: >-
    WhatsApp is a cross-platform messaging and voice-over-IP application owned by Meta
    (Facebook) with over 2 billion users worldwide. It provides end-to-end encrypted text
    messaging, voice calls, video calls, file sharing, group chats, and status updates.
    WhatsApp Business offers enterprise features including catalogs, automated responses,
    and customer communication APIs. Available on iOS, Android, web, and desktop platforms,
    it is the dominant messaging application in many countries across Europe, Latin America,
    Africa, and Asia.
  why: >-
    WhatsApp has been targeted by sophisticated spyware operations, most notably the Pegasus
    spyware (NSO Group) which exploited a zero-click vulnerability (CVE-2019-3568) in
    WhatsApp's VoIP stack to install surveillance software without user interaction. Despite
    end-to-end encryption, WhatsApp metadata (contact lists, message timing, group memberships)
    provides intelligence value. WhatsApp Web and Desktop clients expand the attack surface
    through browser-based vulnerabilities. The platform is used for social engineering,
    business email compromise (BEC) via WhatsApp Business, and distribution of malicious
    links and files. Backup files stored in Google Drive or iCloud may not maintain E2E
    encryption, creating data exposure risks.
  how: >-
    WhatsApp uses the Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption of messages and calls.
    Communication flows through WhatsApp servers (Meta infrastructure) which relay encrypted
    messages between clients. The mobile app serves as the primary platform with WhatsApp
    Web/Desktop mirroring the phone session via QR code pairing. Voice and video calls use
    SRTP with the Signal Protocol for key exchange. WhatsApp Business API enables programmatic
    messaging through approved Business Service Providers. Message backups can be stored
    in Google Drive (Android) or iCloud (iOS) with optional E2E encrypted backup. Group
    chats support up to 1024 participants with shared group encryption keys.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Zero-Click Spyware Exploitation"
      value: "WhatsApp's VoIP stack has been exploited by state-sponsored spyware (Pegasus) through zero-click vulnerabilities requiring no user interaction for device compromise"
    - key: "Metadata Intelligence Value"
      value: "Despite E2E encryption, WhatsApp metadata including contact lists, message timing, and group memberships provides significant intelligence for surveillance operations"
    - key: "Backup Encryption Gap"
      value: "Message backups in Google Drive or iCloud may lack E2E encryption by default, creating data exposure for messages that were encrypted in transit"

  embedding_text: >-
    WhatsApp is a Meta-owned cross-platform messaging application with over 2 billion users
    providing E2E encrypted messaging, voice/video calls, and file sharing. It has been
    targeted by sophisticated spyware including NSO Group's Pegasus via zero-click VoIP
    vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-3568). Despite encryption, metadata provides intelligence
    value for surveillance. WhatsApp Web/Desktop expand the attack surface. The platform is
    used for social engineering, BEC via WhatsApp Business, and malicious link distribution.
    Backup files in Google Drive or iCloud may lack E2E encryption. Security teams should
    keep WhatsApp clients updated, enforce encrypted backups, monitor for suspicious account
    activity, implement mobile device management policies, and assess risks of business
    communications on the platform.
