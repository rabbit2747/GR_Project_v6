definition:
  what: >-
    Cloud Infrastructure refers to the collective set of virtualized compute, storage, networking,
    and platform resources delivered as on-demand services by cloud service providers such as
    AWS, Azure, and GCP. It encompasses the physical data centers, hypervisors, virtual machines,
    containers, serverless runtimes, software-defined networking, and object/block storage that
    form the foundation for cloud-based application deployment. Cloud infrastructure operates
    under shared responsibility models between providers and customers.
  why: >-
    Cloud infrastructure has become the dominant computing model for enterprises, creating a
    massive and dynamic attack surface. Understanding cloud infrastructure is essential for
    cybersecurity because it introduces unique threat vectors including misconfigured services,
    excessive IAM permissions, exposed APIs, insecure defaults, and multi-tenant isolation
    failures. The shared responsibility model means organizations must actively secure their
    portion of the cloud stack or face data breaches and compliance violations.
  how: >-
    Cloud infrastructure is provisioned through provider management consoles, APIs, CLIs, and
    Infrastructure-as-Code tools. Compute resources run on hypervisor-managed hardware in
    geographically distributed data centers organized into regions and availability zones.
    Software-defined networking provides virtual networks, load balancers, and DNS services.
    Identity and access management controls authentication and authorization. Monitoring,
    logging, and security services provide observability and threat detection across the stack.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Shared Responsibility Model"
      value: "Cloud providers secure the infrastructure layer while customers are responsible for securing their data, configurations, and application workloads"
    - key: "Infrastructure as Code"
      value: "Programmatic provisioning and management of cloud resources through declarative templates enabling version control and automated compliance"
    - key: "Multi-Tenancy"
      value: "Physical infrastructure shared among multiple customers with logical isolation enforced through hypervisors, virtual networks, and access controls"

    Cloud Infrastructure encompasses the virtualized compute, storage, networking, and platform

    It includes physical data centers, hypervisors, virtual machines, containers, serverless
    runtimes, software-defined networking, and storage systems organized into geographically
    distributed regions and availability zones. Cloud infrastructure operates under shared
    responsibility models where providers secure the physical layer while customers secure their
    workloads and configurations. Key security concerns include misconfigured services, excessive
    IAM permissions, exposed APIs, multi-tenant isolation failures, and the need for
    Infrastructure-as-Code to enable auditable and repeatable deployments.
