definition:
  what: >-
    An Application Configuration Database is a specialized data store that centralizes and manages
    configuration parameters, feature flags, environment-specific settings, and runtime properties
    for one or more applications. Unlike general-purpose databases, it is purpose-built to serve
    application configuration data with low-latency reads, versioning, and change propagation
    capabilities. Examples include Azure App Configuration, AWS AppConfig, Spring Cloud Config
    Server backed by a database, and HashiCorp Consul KV store when used for application settings.
  why: >-
    Application Configuration Databases exist to decouple configuration from application code,
    enabling dynamic runtime changes without redeployment. They provide centralized governance
    over settings that would otherwise be scattered across environment variables, property files,
    and hardcoded values. This centralization supports environment parity, audit trails for
    configuration changes, feature flag management, and consistent configuration across
    distributed microservice architectures.
  how: >-
    Application Configuration Databases typically expose a key-value or hierarchical data model
    optimized for fast reads. They support namespace or label-based organization to separate
    configurations by environment, application, or tenant. Change notification mechanisms such
    as polling, webhooks, or pub/sub push updated values to connected applications. Access is
    controlled through authentication and role-based authorization. Versioning and change history
    enable rollback to previous configurations. Encryption at rest and in transit protects
    sensitive configuration values such as connection strings and API keys.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Configuration Centralization"
      value: >-
        Consolidates application settings from multiple sources into a single authoritative
        store, eliminating configuration drift and enabling consistent management across
        environments and services.
    - key: "Dynamic Configuration"
      value: >-
        Supports runtime configuration changes that propagate to running applications without
        requiring redeployment, enabling feature flags, A/B testing, and operational tuning.
    - key: "Configuration Versioning"
      value: >-
        Maintains a history of configuration changes with timestamps and authorship, supporting
        audit requirements and enabling rollback to known-good states.

  embedding_text: >-
    An Application Configuration Database is a specialized data store that centralizes application
    configuration parameters, feature flags, environment-specific settings, and runtime properties.
    It decouples configuration from application code, enabling dynamic changes without redeployment.
    These databases use key-value or hierarchical data models optimized for fast reads and support
    namespace-based organization for multi-environment separation. Change notification mechanisms
    propagate updates to connected applications. Access control, encryption, versioning, and audit
    trails protect sensitive configuration values. Common implementations include Azure App
    Configuration, AWS AppConfig, Spring Cloud Config Server, and HashiCorp Consul KV. Application
    configuration databases are critical infrastructure in microservice architectures where
    consistent configuration across distributed services is essential for reliability and security.
