definition:
  what: >-
    A Kiosk Computer is a purpose-built computing terminal designed for public or semi-public
    access with restricted functionality, typically running Windows Kiosk Mode, Chrome OS
    Kiosk, or Linux in locked-down configurations. Kiosks serve specific functions such as
    point-of-sale, check-in, information display, wayfinding, or self-service transactions.
    They use hardened OS configurations that restrict users to approved applications and
    prevent access to the underlying operating system.
  why: >-
    Kiosk computers are high-risk targets because they operate in physically accessible
    locations with limited monitoring. Attackers can escape kiosk mode through keyboard
    shortcuts, dialog box exploits, URL handler abuse, or accessibility feature exploitation
    to gain shell access. Compromised kiosks can expose payment card data, PII, corporate
    network access, and serve as pivot points into internal networks. USB-based attacks are
    common against physically accessible kiosk hardware.
  how: >-
    Kiosks are configured using Windows Assigned Access (single-app kiosk), Shell Launcher
    (multi-app kiosk), Group Policy restrictions, or purpose-built kiosk management software.
    Security hardening includes disabling keyboard shortcuts, removing accessibility shortcuts,
    blocking USB mass storage, implementing application whitelisting, using kiosk-specific
    browser configurations, enabling automatic session reset, and network segmentation to
    isolate kiosks from production networks. Physical security includes tamper-resistant
    enclosures and cable locks.

    A Kiosk Computer is a purpose-built terminal for public or semi-public access running
    restricted OS configurations like Windows Kiosk Mode. Located in physically accessible
    areas, kiosks are targeted through escape attacks using keyboard shortcuts, dialog
    exploits, URL handlers, or accessibility features. Compromised kiosks expose payment data,
    PII, and network access. Hardening includes Assigned Access lockdown, disabling shortcuts,
    blocking USB storage, application whitelisting, automatic session reset, and network
    segmentation. Physical security requires tamper-resistant enclosures.
