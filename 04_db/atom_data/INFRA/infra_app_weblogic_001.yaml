definition:
  what: >-
    Oracle WebLogic Server is a Java EE (Jakarta EE) application server used for developing
    and deploying enterprise Java applications, web services, and distributed computing
    workloads. It provides a runtime environment for Java-based applications with features
    including clustering, load balancing, JMS messaging, transaction management, and web
    service support. WebLogic is widely deployed in large enterprises and government
    organizations for mission-critical business applications.
  why: >-
    WebLogic Server has an extensive history of critical deserialization vulnerabilities that
    enable unauthenticated remote code execution, including CVE-2017-10271, CVE-2019-2725,
    CVE-2020-14882, and CVE-2023-21839. These vulnerabilities have been widely exploited by
    cryptomining malware, ransomware, and nation-state actors. The T3 and IIOP protocols used
    by WebLogic are particularly vulnerable to deserialization attacks. WebLogic's administration
    console (port 7001) is frequently exposed to the internet. The platform's role hosting
    critical business applications means successful exploitation provides access to sensitive
    enterprise data and backend systems.
  how: >-
    WebLogic Server runs as a Java process hosting application domains with managed server
    instances. The administration server provides a web console (typically port 7001/7002)
    for configuration management. T3 protocol (proprietary) and IIOP handle inter-process
    communication and remote method invocation. Applications are deployed as WAR/EAR archives.
    WebLogic uses JDBC for database connectivity, JMS for messaging, and supports SOAP/REST
    web services. Clustering enables high availability across multiple server instances.
    Node Manager handles remote server lifecycle management.

    Oracle WebLogic Server is a Java EE application server for enterprise applications with
    clustering, JMS, and web service support. It has an extensive history of critical
    deserialization vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-10271, CVE-2019-2725, CVE-2020-14882,
    CVE-2023-21839) in T3 and IIOP protocols enabling unauthenticated RCE. The administration
    console on port 7001 is frequently internet-exposed. WebLogic is targeted by cryptominers,
    ransomware, and nation-state actors. Its role hosting mission-critical applications means
    exploitation provides access to sensitive enterprise data. Security teams should restrict
    T3/IIOP protocol access, avoid exposing the admin console, apply Oracle Critical Patch
    Updates promptly, implement network segmentation, and monitor for deserialization exploit
    attempts.
