definition:
  what: >-
    DISM Host (DismHost.exe) is the Windows process that hosts the DISM servicing engine in a
    separate process when servicing online or offline Windows images. It loads DismCore.dll and
    the appropriate provider DLLs to perform image servicing operations in an isolated process
    context. DISM Host acts as the execution container for DISM operations initiated by dism.exe
    or the DISM PowerShell module.
  why: >-
    DISM Host runs with SYSTEM privileges and can be abused for privilege escalation or defense
    evasion. As a signed Microsoft binary, it can be used for DLL side-loading attacks where
    malicious DLLs are loaded instead of legitimate DISM providers. Monitoring DismHost.exe
    process creation and loaded modules is important for detecting abuse of Windows servicing
    mechanisms for malicious purposes.
  how: >-
    DismHost.exe is spawned by dism.exe or the DISM API when servicing operations are requested.
    It loads DismCore.dll and provider DLLs from the Windows system directory. The host process
    communicates with the parent process via named pipes or RPC. When servicing is complete,
    the host process terminates. It operates at SYSTEM privilege level to modify Windows system
    files, registry, and component store.
