definition:
  what: >-
    AWS VPC Lattice is an application networking service that connects, secures, and monitors
    communication between services across multiple VPCs and AWS accounts. It provides
    application-layer (Layer 7) service-to-service connectivity with built-in authentication,
    authorization, and observability without requiring complex networking infrastructure like
    service meshes, load balancers, or VPC peering. VPC Lattice operates as a managed service
    network that simplifies microservices communication patterns.
  why: >-
    As organizations adopt microservices architectures spanning multiple VPCs and accounts,
    managing service-to-service connectivity becomes increasingly complex. VPC Lattice
    eliminates the need for custom networking solutions by providing a managed application
    networking layer with built-in security policies. From a security perspective, it enforces
    authentication and authorization at the service network level, reducing the attack surface
    for lateral movement between microservices.
  how: >-
    VPC Lattice defines service networks that group related services together. Services register
    with target groups behind listeners that define routing rules. Auth policies using IAM
    control which services can communicate. Traffic is routed through the AWS-managed VPC Lattice
    data plane without requiring VPC peering or transit gateways. Access logs capture request
    metadata for auditing and monitoring. Integration with AWS Resource Access Manager enables
    cross-account service sharing.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Service Network"
      value: "A logical grouping of services and VPCs that defines the communication boundary and shared access policies for service-to-service traffic"
    - key: "Application-Layer Networking"
      value: "Layer 7 routing and load balancing for services without requiring complex network infrastructure like service meshes or VPC peering"
    - key: "IAM-Based Auth Policies"
      value: "Fine-grained authentication and authorization policies controlling which services can communicate within the service network"
