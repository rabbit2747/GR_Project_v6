definition:
  what: >-
    Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform originally developed
    by Google that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    The architecture consists of a control plane (API server, etcd, scheduler, controller
    manager) and worker nodes (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime). Kubernetes manages
    workloads through declarative configurations using Pods, Deployments, Services, and other
    resource types, with RBAC for access control and Namespaces for multi-tenancy.
  why: >-
    Kubernetes clusters are prime attack targets due to their role orchestrating critical
    workloads. Attack vectors include exposed API servers, misconfigured RBAC (cluster-admin
    to anonymous users), container escape to node, etcd data exposure, supply chain attacks
    through malicious container images, secrets stored unencrypted in etcd, service account
    token abuse, and lateral movement between pods. The MITRE ATT&CK Containers Matrix
    documents systematic Kubernetes attack techniques.
  how: >-
    The API server authenticates requests via certificates, tokens, or OIDC, then authorizes
    via RBAC. Admission controllers (PodSecurity, OPA Gatekeeper) enforce security policies.
    Network policies restrict pod-to-pod communication. Secrets management uses etcd encryption
    at rest or external vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Container runtime
    security uses seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux profiles. Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) provides
    mTLS between services. Audit logging tracks API server operations for security monitoring.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "RBAC and API Server Security"
      value: "Role-Based Access Control governs all Kubernetes API access; misconfigured RBAC is the most common vulnerability enabling privilege escalation"
    - key: "Container Escape and Node Compromise"
      value: "Container breakout via kernel exploits, privileged containers, or hostPath mounts enables node-level access and cluster-wide compromise"
    - key: "Supply Chain Security"
      value: "Container image provenance, image signing, admission controllers, and registry security prevent deployment of compromised or vulnerable images"
