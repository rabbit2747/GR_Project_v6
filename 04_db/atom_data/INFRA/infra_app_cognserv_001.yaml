definition:
  what: >-
    Azure Cognitive Services is a collection of cloud-based AI APIs and services provided by
    Microsoft that enable developers to integrate intelligent capabilities into applications
    without requiring direct AI or data science expertise. The platform includes services for
    vision, speech, language, decision-making, and search, accessible through REST APIs and
    client SDKs. Services include Computer Vision, Face API, Speech-to-Text, Text Analytics,
    Translator, and Azure OpenAI Service among others.
  why: >-
    Cognitive Services present security concerns as they process potentially sensitive data
    including images, audio, and text through cloud endpoints. API key management is a common
    attack surface, as leaked or exposed keys grant access to billable AI services. Adversaries
    may abuse these services for reconnaissance (OCR on captured screenshots), data exfiltration
    (translation services as covert channels), or to augment attack tooling with AI capabilities.
    Misconfigured access controls can expose private cognitive endpoints to unauthorized use.
  how: >-
    Cognitive Services operate as managed cloud APIs hosted on Azure infrastructure. Applications
    authenticate using subscription keys or Azure Active Directory tokens, then make REST API
    calls to service endpoints. Each service processes input data (images, audio, text) through
    specialized AI models and returns structured results. Services can be deployed as multi-tenant
    cloud endpoints or as containers for on-premises deployment. Data processing policies vary
    by service, with some retaining input data for model improvement unless opted out.

    - key: "API Key Exposure Risk"

    - key: "Data Processing Pipeline"
      value: "Input data flows through cloud-hosted AI models with configurable data retention and processing policies per service"

  embedding_text: >-
    Azure Cognitive Services is a Microsoft cloud platform providing pre-built AI APIs for
    vision, speech, language, decision, and search capabilities. Applications authenticate
    using subscription keys or Azure AD tokens to access REST endpoints that process data
    through specialized AI models. Security concerns include API key exposure granting
    unauthorized access to billable services, data processing through cloud endpoints
    potentially handling sensitive information, and adversary abuse of AI capabilities for
    reconnaissance or attack augmentation. Services can be deployed as cloud endpoints or
    on-premises containers. Common attack surfaces include leaked subscription keys,
    misconfigured access controls, and data retention policies. Security teams should
    monitor API usage patterns, rotate keys regularly, and enforce Azure AD authentication
    over simple key-based access.
