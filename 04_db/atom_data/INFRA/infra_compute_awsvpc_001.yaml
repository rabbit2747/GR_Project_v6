definition:
  what: >-
    AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated virtual network within the AWS
    cloud that provides complete control over IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and
    network gateways. VPCs serve as the foundational network boundary for AWS resources,
    enabling organizations to define public and private subnets, configure security groups
    and network ACLs, establish VPN connections, and implement network segmentation strategies
    that mirror traditional on-premises network architectures.
  why: >-
    VPC is the fundamental network isolation mechanism in AWS, controlling which resources
    can communicate with each other and the internet. Misconfigured VPCs are a leading cause
    of cloud security incidents, including overly permissive security groups, public subnet
    exposure, and inadequate network segmentation. Understanding VPC architecture is essential
    for implementing defense-in-depth network security in AWS environments.
  how: >-
    VPCs are created with a specified CIDR block and divided into subnets across availability
    zones. Route tables control traffic flow between subnets and gateways. Security groups
    provide stateful instance-level firewall rules, while network ACLs provide stateless
    subnet-level filtering. Internet gateways enable public internet access, NAT gateways
    provide outbound-only connectivity, and VPC endpoints enable private AWS service access
    without traversing the internet. VPC Flow Logs capture network traffic metadata for
    monitoring and forensics.

    AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated virtual network within the AWS cloud

    VPCs are the foundational network boundary for AWS resources, enabling public and private
    subnet configuration, security groups for stateful instance-level firewalling, and network
    ACLs for stateless subnet-level filtering. Key components include internet gateways for
    public access, NAT gateways for outbound-only connectivity, VPC endpoints for private
    service access, and VPC Flow Logs for network traffic monitoring and forensics. VPC
    misconfiguration is a leading cause of cloud security incidents including unauthorized
    access and data exposure.
