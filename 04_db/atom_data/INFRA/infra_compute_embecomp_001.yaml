definition:
  what: >-
    An Embedded Computer is a specialized computing system designed to perform dedicated functions
    within a larger mechanical or electrical system. Embedded computers use microcontrollers or
    system-on-chip (SoC) processors running real-time operating systems (RTOS) or bare-metal
    firmware. They are found in industrial control systems, medical devices, automotive systems,
    network equipment, consumer electronics, and IoT devices, typically with constrained resources
    (limited memory, processing power, and storage).
  why: >-
    Embedded computers represent a massive and often poorly secured attack surface. Many run
    outdated firmware without security updates, use default credentials, lack encryption, and
    have no monitoring capabilities. Compromised embedded systems in critical infrastructure
    (ICS/SCADA, medical devices, automotive) can have physical safety implications. The
    Mirai botnet demonstrated how compromised embedded devices can be weaponized at scale.
  how: >-
    Embedded computers execute firmware stored in flash memory, running RTOS (FreeRTOS, VxWorks,
    QNX) or embedded Linux. They communicate via serial (UART, SPI, I2C), network (Ethernet,
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee), or industrial protocols (Modbus, BACnet, CAN bus). Firmware
    updates are delivered via OTA, USB, or serial interfaces. Security measures include secure
    boot, firmware signing, hardware security modules, and network segmentation to isolate
    embedded devices from IT networks.
