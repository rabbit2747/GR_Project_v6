definition:
  what: >-
    A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is a centralized repository that stores information
    about all significant IT assets and configuration items (CIs) within an organization, along
    with the relationships between them. Defined by ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure
    Library), a CMDB maintains records of hardware, software, documentation, personnel, and
    services alongside their dependencies, ownership, and lifecycle states. Major CMDB implementations
    include ServiceNow CMDB, BMC Atrium, Micro Focus UCMDB, and Device42.
  why: >-
    CMDBs are essential for IT service management, incident response, change management, and
    security operations. They provide a single source of truth for understanding the IT
    environment's composition and interdependencies. During security incidents, a CMDB enables
    rapid identification of affected assets, their owners, criticality levels, and downstream
    dependencies. For compliance, CMDBs support asset inventory requirements mandated by
    frameworks such as NIST CSF, CIS Controls, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS.
  how: >-
    CMDBs are populated through automated discovery tools that scan networks and systems to
    identify assets, agent-based collection from endpoints, integration with IT service
    management (ITSM) workflows, and manual data entry. Configuration items are categorized
    by type (server, application, network device, database) with attributes including owner,
    location, criticality, environment, and lifecycle state. Relationship mapping captures
    dependencies such as runs-on, connects-to, and depends-on. Federation allows CMDBs to
    aggregate data from multiple authoritative sources while maintaining data lineage. Access
    control restricts modification to authorized personnel and change management processes.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Configuration Items (CIs)"
      value: >-
        Individual IT assets or components tracked in the CMDB, each with a unique identifier,
        classification, attributes, and relationship mappings to other CIs in the environment.
    - key: "Relationship Mapping"
      value: >-
        Captures dependencies and connections between CIs such as runs-on, connects-to,
        depends-on, and managed-by, enabling impact analysis for changes and incidents.
    - key: "Automated Discovery"
      value: >-
        Network scanning, agent-based collection, and API integration automatically populate
        and update the CMDB, reducing manual effort and improving data accuracy.
    - key: "ITIL Service Management Integration"
      value: >-
        CMDBs integrate with ITIL processes including incident management, change management,
        problem management, and service level management to provide context for IT operations.

    A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is a centralized repository storing information
    about IT assets and configuration items (CIs) along with their relationships, as defined by
    ITIL. CMDBs maintain records of hardware, software, documentation, personnel, and services
    with dependency mapping. They are populated through automated discovery, agent-based
    collection, and ITSM workflow integration. CIs are categorized with attributes including
    owner, criticality, environment, and lifecycle state. Relationship mapping captures
    dependencies like runs-on, connects-to, and depends-on for impact analysis. CMDBs support
    incident response by enabling rapid identification of affected assets and dependencies,
    change management through impact assessment, and compliance with NIST CSF, CIS Controls,
    ISO 27001, and PCI DSS asset inventory requirements. Major implementations include
    ServiceNow CMDB, BMC Atrium, and Micro Focus UCMDB.
