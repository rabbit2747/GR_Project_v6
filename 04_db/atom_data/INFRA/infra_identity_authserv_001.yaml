definition:
  what: >-
    An Authentication Server is a dedicated infrastructure component responsible for verifying
    the identity of users, services, and devices attempting to access network resources. It
    processes authentication requests using protocols such as Kerberos, RADIUS, LDAP, SAML,
    and OAuth, validating credentials against an identity store and issuing authentication
    tokens, tickets, or assertions that grant access to protected systems. Authentication
    servers may operate as standalone appliances, dedicated server roles, or cloud-hosted
    identity provider services.
  why: >-
    Authentication servers are high-value targets because they represent the central trust
    anchor for identity verification across the environment. Compromise of an authentication
    server enables attackers to forge credentials, bypass multi-factor authentication, issue
    unauthorized tokens, and impersonate any user or service account. Attacks targeting
    authentication infrastructure include credential stuffing, Kerberos ticket manipulation
    (Golden/Silver Ticket), RADIUS secret extraction, and identity provider configuration
    tampering. Availability attacks against authentication servers can deny service to
    all dependent systems.
  how: >-
    Authentication servers receive credential submissions from clients, validate them against
    an identity store (directory service, database, or external IdP), and return
    authentication results in the form of tickets (Kerberos TGT), tokens (OAuth JWT), or
    assertions (SAML). The server enforces authentication policies including password
    complexity, account lockout, MFA requirements, and conditional access rules. Load
    balancing and redundancy are typically implemented to ensure high availability.
    Communication channels are secured with TLS, and audit logging captures all
    authentication events for security monitoring.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Credential Validation"
      value: "Verifies submitted credentials against authoritative identity stores using standard protocols like Kerberos, LDAP, RADIUS, and OAuth"
    - key: "Token Issuance"
      value: "Issues authentication artifacts such as Kerberos tickets, JWT tokens, or SAML assertions upon successful credential verification"
    - key: "Central Trust Anchor"
      value: "Acts as the authoritative identity verification point for the environment, making it a critical target for attackers seeking broad access"

  embedding_text: >-
    An Authentication Server is a critical infrastructure component that verifies user,
    service, and device identities by processing authentication requests through protocols
    such as Kerberos, RADIUS, LDAP, SAML, and OAuth. It validates credentials against an
    identity store and issues authentication tokens, tickets, or assertions granting access
    to protected resources. Authentication servers are high-value targets because their
    compromise enables credential forgery, MFA bypass, and unauthorized token issuance.
    Attacks include Golden Ticket forgery, RADIUS secret extraction, and authentication
    process modification. The server enforces authentication policies including password
    requirements, lockout thresholds, and conditional access. Security teams must ensure
    authentication server hardening, monitoring of authentication events, redundancy for
    availability, and protection of cryptographic material used for token generation.
