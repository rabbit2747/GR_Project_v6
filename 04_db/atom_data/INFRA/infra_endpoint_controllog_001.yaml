definition:
  what: >-
    ControlLogix is a family of modular, rack-based programmable automation controllers (PACs)
    manufactured by Rockwell Automation under the Allen-Bradley brand. The platform uses the
    1756 chassis system with hot-swappable I/O modules and supports multiple communication
    protocols including EtherNet/IP, ControlNet, DeviceNet, and serial. ControlLogix controllers
    (such as 1756-L71, L72, L73, L8x series) are used in large-scale discrete, process, batch,
    motion, and safety control applications across manufacturing, oil and gas, water treatment,
    and power generation industries.
  why: >-
    ControlLogix PLCs are high-value targets in ICS/SCADA security because they directly control
    physical processes in critical infrastructure. Compromise of these controllers can lead to
    process manipulation, equipment damage, environmental disasters, or safety hazards. Threat
    groups including XENOTIME and CHERNOVITE have specifically targeted Rockwell Automation
    controllers. CVEs affecting ControlLogix firmware and the CIP protocol can enable unauthorized
    program uploads, denial of service, or remote code execution on the controller.
  how: >-
    ControlLogix operates using the Logix5000 control engine executing ladder logic, structured
    text, function block, and sequential function chart programs. Controllers communicate via
    the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) over EtherNet/IP for configuration, programming, and
    real-time I/O data exchange. The modular 1756 chassis accepts processor, communication,
    I/O, and specialty modules. Programming is performed through Rockwell Studio 5000 Logix
    Designer. Security features include CIP Security with TLS/DTLS encryption, controller
    mode switches (Run/Program/Remote), and user authentication on newer firmware versions.

    system with hot-swappable modules, it supports EtherNet/IP, ControlNet, DeviceNet, and

    deployed in large-scale manufacturing, oil and gas, water treatment, and power generation
    for discrete, process, batch, motion, and safety control. From a cybersecurity perspective,
    ControlLogix PLCs are high-value ICS targets that have been specifically targeted by threat
    groups including XENOTIME and CHERNOVITE. Vulnerabilities in CIP protocol and controller
    firmware can enable unauthorized program manipulation, denial of service, or remote code
    execution. Newer firmware versions support CIP Security with TLS/DTLS encryption.
