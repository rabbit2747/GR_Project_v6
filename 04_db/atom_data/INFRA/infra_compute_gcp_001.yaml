definition:
  what: >-
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is Google's public cloud computing platform offering compute,
    storage, networking, machine learning, and security services. GCP provides Compute Engine
    (VMs), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Run (serverless containers), Cloud Functions
    (serverless), and a comprehensive suite of managed services. GCP infrastructure runs on
    Google's global fiber network across multiple regions and availability zones.
  why: >-
    GCP is a major cloud provider targeted by attackers seeking to exploit misconfigured IAM
    policies, exposed Cloud Storage buckets, overly permissive firewall rules, and service
    account key leaks. GCP's metadata server is targeted via SSRF for credential theft.
    Organization-level misconfigurations can expose entire enterprises. The shared responsibility
    model means customers must secure their workloads, IAM, and data within GCP services.
  how: >-
    GCP resources are organized into projects within organizations, managed via IAM with
    service accounts and Workload Identity Federation. Network security uses VPC networks,
    firewall rules, and Cloud Armor WAF. Security Command Center provides threat detection
    and vulnerability scanning. Cloud KMS manages encryption keys. Organization Policy Service
    enforces compliance constraints. Access Transparency and Access Approval provide audit
    controls for Google support access.

  embedding_text: >-
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a major public cloud provider offering compute, storage,
    networking, and ML services. Resources are organized in projects within organizations
    with hierarchical IAM policies. Security concerns include misconfigured IAM, exposed
    Cloud Storage buckets, service account key leaks, and metadata server SSRF attacks.
    Security Command Center provides centralized threat detection. Cloud KMS manages encryption.
    VPC networks and Cloud Armor WAF protect network perimeter. Workload Identity Federation
    eliminates service account key management risks.
