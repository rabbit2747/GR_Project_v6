# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    A Phishing Simulation Platform is a security awareness training tool that sends simulated
    phishing emails to employees to measure susceptibility and improve security behavior.
    Products include KnowBe4, Proofpoint Security Awareness, Cofense PhishMe, Microsoft
    Attack Simulation Training, and Barracuda PhishLine. Platforms provide campaign management,
    template libraries, click tracking, reporting dashboards, and remedial training content.
  why: >-
    Phishing remains the most common initial access vector for cyberattacks, with over 90% of
    breaches involving a social engineering element. Simulation platforms quantify organizational
    phishing risk and reduce click rates through repeated testing and training. Compliance
    frameworks including NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS recommend or require security
    awareness training. Metrics from simulations inform security investment decisions.
  how: >-
    Platforms integrate with email infrastructure (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, SMTP relays)
    to deliver simulated phishing emails. Campaign managers select or customize templates
    mimicking real-world phishing tactics (credential harvesting, malicious attachments, BEC).
    Tracking pixels and landing pages record user interactions (open, click, credential
    submission). Results feed into reporting dashboards showing department-level risk scores
    and improvement trends. Failed users are automatically enrolled in remedial training modules.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Behavioral Change"
      value: "Repeated simulated phishing exposure combined with immediate feedback and training reduces employee susceptibility over time"
    - key: "Risk Quantification"
      value: "Click rates, report rates, and susceptibility trends provide measurable metrics for organizational phishing risk"
    - key: "Compliance Training"
      value: "Security awareness training satisfies requirements in NIST CSF, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance frameworks"
