definition:
  what: >-
    LANDESK (now Ivanti Endpoint Manager) is an enterprise endpoint management platform
    providing OS deployment, software distribution, patch management, remote control, inventory
    management, and security compliance for Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. Originally
    developed by LANDesk Software (later acquired by Ivanti in 2017), the platform uses a
    core server architecture with management agents deployed on endpoints. The management
    console provides centralized visibility and control over the entire endpoint fleet.
  why: >-
    LANDESK/Ivanti Endpoint Manager is a critical security tool because it manages patch
    deployment, security configurations, and software compliance across enterprise endpoints.
    However, the management platform itself is also a high-value target: its agent runs with
    SYSTEM privileges on every managed endpoint, the core server contains credentials and
    network topology data, and vulnerabilities in the management infrastructure can provide
    attackers with enterprise-wide access. LANDESK has had multiple CVEs including SQL injection,
    remote code execution, and authentication bypass vulnerabilities that enable complete
    management infrastructure compromise.
  how: >-
    LANDESK operates through a core server running on Windows Server with a SQL Server database
    storing inventory, policy, and credential data. Management agents (CBA8, TMCSvc) run on
    endpoints communicating via HTTP/HTTPS to the core server for policy retrieval and status
    reporting. Software distribution uses preferred servers and content replication. Patch
    management scans endpoints against vulnerability definitions and deploys patches through
    scheduled tasks. Remote control uses a client-server model for technical support sessions.
    The management console provides role-based access to administration functions.

  embedding_text: >-
    LANDESK (now Ivanti Endpoint Manager) is an enterprise endpoint management platform
    providing OS deployment, software distribution, patch management, remote control, and
    security compliance for Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. The architecture uses
    a core server with SQL Server database and management agents running as SYSTEM on endpoints.
    Originally from LANDesk Software and acquired by Ivanti in 2017, the platform is both a
    critical security tool for patch management and a high-value attack target. Management
    agents with SYSTEM privileges on every endpoint make the infrastructure attractive for
    lateral movement. Multiple CVEs document SQL injection, remote code execution, and
    authentication bypass vulnerabilities. MITRE ATT&CK maps software deployment tools like
    LANDESK under T1072 for execution and lateral movement via trusted management infrastructure.
