  what: >-
    Azure Sentinel (now Microsoft Sentinel) is a cloud-native Security Information and Event
    Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution
    built on Azure. It collects security data from across the enterprise using data connectors
    for Microsoft 365, Azure, AWS, GCP, on-premises infrastructure, and third-party security
    products. Sentinel uses Kusto Query Language (KQL) for log analytics, built-in AI for
    threat detection, workbooks for visualization, and playbooks (Logic Apps) for automated
    response orchestration.
  why: >-
    Sentinel addresses the need for scalable, cloud-native SIEM that can handle the volume and
    velocity of modern security data without the infrastructure management burden of traditional
    SIEM deployments. It provides detection for advanced persistent threats, insider threats,
    multi-stage attacks, and cloud-specific threats across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
    Integration with Microsoft threat intelligence, MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping, and
    automated investigation reduces mean time to detect and respond for security operations.
  how: >-
    Sentinel operates on Azure Log Analytics workspaces, ingesting data through over 100 built-in
    data connectors including Syslog, CEF, REST API, and agent-based collection. Analytics rules
    detect threats by correlating events across data sources. Incidents are created from alerts
    and managed through the investigation graph. SOAR capabilities use Azure Logic Apps playbooks
    triggered by analytics rules or incidents. Threat hunting uses KQL queries and Jupyter
    notebooks. Content hub provides community and Microsoft-authored detection rules, workbooks,
    and playbooks. Cost is based on data ingestion volume with commitment tiers available.

    detection and incident management. It maps to MITRE ATT&CK, supports multi-stage attack
    detection, and provides investigation graphs. Sentinel addresses scalability challenges of
    traditional SIEM by leveraging cloud infrastructure, reducing MTTD and MTTR through automated
    investigation and response. Pricing is based on data ingestion volume.
