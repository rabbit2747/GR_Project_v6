  what: >-
    OpenStack is an open-source cloud infrastructure platform for building and managing public
    and private clouds. It consists of modular services including Nova (compute), Neutron
    (networking), Cinder (block storage), Swift (object storage), Keystone (identity), Glance
    (image service), and Heat (orchestration). OpenStack provides IaaS capabilities comparable
    to public cloud providers but deployed on-premises or in colocation environments, giving
    organizations full control over their cloud infrastructure.
  why: >-
    OpenStack deployments are targeted because they host critical workloads with full
    administrative control available to the operator. Security concerns include Keystone
    authentication bypass, Nova compute injection, Neutron network isolation failures,
    misconfigured security groups, exposed management APIs, insecure inter-service
    communication, and image tampering in Glance. The complexity of OpenStack deployments
    (dozens of services, configuration files) makes misconfiguration a primary attack vector.
  how: >-
    Keystone provides centralized identity, authentication, and service catalog. Nova manages
    VM lifecycle using libvirt/KVM, Xen, or VMware hypervisors. Neutron provides software-
    defined networking with security groups, floating IPs, and network namespaces. Barbican
    manages secrets and encryption keys. Oslo.policy defines RBAC across all services. TLS
    encrypts inter-service communication. Security groups filter network traffic at the
    hypervisor level. Audit middleware logs all API requests. Hardening guides (CIS, NIST)
    provide security baselines for OpenStack deployments.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Modular Service Architecture"
      value: "Dozens of loosely coupled services with independent APIs, configuration, and security policies create a complex attack surface requiring comprehensive hardening"
    - key: "Keystone Identity Service"
      value: "Centralized authentication and authorization for all OpenStack services; Keystone compromise grants access to the entire cloud infrastructure"
    - key: "Tenant Network Isolation"
      value: "Neutron provides network isolation between tenants via VLANs, VXLAN, or GRE tunnels; isolation failures enable cross-tenant data access"

  embedding_text: >-
    OpenStack is an open-source cloud infrastructure platform with modular services including
    Nova (compute), Neutron (networking), Keystone (identity), Cinder (storage), and Swift
    (object storage). Deployed for private and public clouds with full operator control.
    Security concerns include Keystone authentication bypass, Nova injection, Neutron isolation
    failures, misconfigured security groups, exposed management APIs, and image tampering.
    Configuration complexity makes misconfiguration a primary attack vector. Barbican manages
    secrets. Oslo.policy defines RBAC. TLS encrypts inter-service communication.
