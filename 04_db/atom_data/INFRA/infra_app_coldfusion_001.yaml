  what: >-
    Adobe ColdFusion is a commercial rapid web application development platform and application
    server that uses the ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) to build dynamic websites and web
    applications. It runs as a Java EE application on top of Apache Tomcat and provides built-in
    features for database connectivity, PDF generation, charting, file management, and web service
    integration. ColdFusion can be deployed as a standalone server or as a WAR file on existing
    Java application servers.
  why: >-
    ColdFusion has a long history of critical security vulnerabilities including remote code
    execution (CVE-2023-26360, CVE-2023-29298, CVE-2023-38205), arbitrary file read (CVE-2023-26359),
    and deserialization attacks. Its administrator console, if exposed, provides a direct path to
    server compromise. ColdFusion servers are frequently targeted by attackers due to often being
    outdated, internet-facing, and running with elevated privileges. CISA has added multiple
    ColdFusion vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.
  how: >-
    ColdFusion processes CFML templates through its application server engine, compiling them into
    Java bytecode for execution on the JVM. The server handles HTTP requests through an embedded
    Tomcat instance, routing them to CFML pages that interact with databases via JDBC, generate
    dynamic content, and manage sessions. The ColdFusion Administrator console provides web-based
    management of data sources, scheduled tasks, security settings, and server configuration.
    Exploitation typically targets deserialization endpoints, the administrator console, or
    file upload/read vulnerabilities in the CFML processing engine.

  embedding_text: >-
    Adobe ColdFusion is a commercial web application server using ColdFusion Markup Language
    (CFML) running on Java EE with embedded Apache Tomcat. It provides rapid development
    features including database connectivity, PDF generation, and web service integration.
    ColdFusion has an extensive history of critical security vulnerabilities including remote
    code execution through deserialization (CVE-2023-26360), arbitrary file read, and
    administrator console exploitation. Multiple vulnerabilities appear in CISA Known Exploited
    Vulnerabilities catalog. Common attack vectors target the administrator console, CFML
    template processing engine, and Java deserialization endpoints. ColdFusion servers are
    frequently targeted due to being internet-facing, often outdated, and running with elevated
    privileges. Security teams should restrict administrator console access, apply patches
    promptly, and monitor for exploitation indicators on ColdFusion deployments.
