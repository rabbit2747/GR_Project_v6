definition:
  what: "NetScaler (now Citrix ADC) is an application delivery controller platform that provides layer 4-7 load balancing, SSL/TLS offloading, web application firewall (WAF), VPN gateway, content switching, and application acceleration services. Deployed as hardware appliances, virtual appliances (VPX), or cloud-based instances (CPX), NetScaler sits at the network edge or DMZ to manage, optimize, and secure application traffic. It supports advanced features including global server load balancing (GSLB), HTTP compression, TCP multiplexing, content caching, rate limiting, and integrated authentication through SAML, OAuth, and LDAP. NetScaler Gateway provides SSL VPN remote access and Citrix HDX proxy functionality for virtual desktop infrastructure."
  why: "NetScaler is a critical infrastructure component in enterprise environments because it serves as the primary entry point for application traffic, making it both a high-value target and a key security control. It concentrates SSL/TLS termination, authentication, and access control decisions for multiple backend applications. NetScaler has been the target of significant zero-day vulnerabilities including CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2023-3519 which were widely exploited by threat actors for initial access and remote code execution. Its position at the network perimeter and the sensitive nature of its authentication and session management functions make it a priority for security hardening and monitoring."
  how: "NetScaler is deployed in the DMZ or network edge, configured with virtual IP addresses (VIPs) that serve as the public endpoints for applications. Traffic arrives at the VIP, where NetScaler performs SSL/TLS termination, inspects requests through its application firewall engine, applies content switching policies to route requests to appropriate backend server pools, and load balances across healthy servers using algorithms such as round robin, least connections, or least response time. Health monitoring probes continuously verify backend server availability. The management interface (NSIP) provides CLI, GUI, and API access for configuration. NetScaler logs and metrics integrate with SIEM platforms for security monitoring. Firmware updates are critical for patching vulnerabilities in this internet-facing appliance."
