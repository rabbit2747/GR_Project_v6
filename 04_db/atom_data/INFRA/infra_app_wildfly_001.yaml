definition:
  what: >-
    WildFly (formerly JBoss Application Server) is an open-source Java EE (Jakarta EE)
    application server developed by Red Hat. It provides a full Java EE runtime environment
    supporting EJB, CDI, JPA, JMS, JAX-RS, and other enterprise Java specifications. WildFly
    serves as the upstream community project for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
    (EAP), which is the commercially supported variant. The server supports standalone and
    domain mode deployments with clustering, high availability, and centralized management
    capabilities.
  why: >-
    WildFly and JBoss have been affected by critical deserialization vulnerabilities,
    particularly through the JMXInvokerServlet and EJBInvokerServlet endpoints that accept
    serialized Java objects. CVE-2017-12149 enabled unauthenticated RCE through the HTTP
    Invoker readOnlyAccessFilter bypass. The JBoss administration console (port 9990) has
    been targeted for default credential exploitation and brute-force attacks. JBoss/WildFly
    deployments have been extensively targeted by cryptomining campaigns and ransomware
    operators. The JMX console and web-console applications, if left exposed, provide
    management interfaces that enable WAR file deployment for webshell installation.
  how: >-
    WildFly runs as a Java process with a modular architecture based on JBoss Modules.
    In standalone mode, a single server instance operates independently. Domain mode enables
    centralized management of multiple server instances across hosts through a Domain
    Controller. The management interface operates on port 9990 (HTTP) and 9993 (HTTPS).
    Applications are deployed as WAR/EAR archives through the management console, CLI, or
    file system deployment scanner. The server uses Undertow as its web server subsystem,
    Infinispan for caching, and HornetQ/ActiveMQ Artemis for JMS messaging. Configuration
    is managed through XML files (standalone.xml, domain.xml) and the management API.

    WildFly (formerly JBoss Application Server) is an open-source Java EE application server
    by Red Hat, serving as the upstream for JBoss EAP. It has critical deserialization
    vulnerabilities in JMXInvokerServlet and EJBInvokerServlet (CVE-2017-12149) enabling
    unauthenticated RCE. The management console on port 9990 is targeted for default
    credential exploitation and WAR deployment for webshell installation. JBoss/WildFly
    deployments are extensively targeted by cryptominers and ransomware. Security teams
    should remove or restrict JMX/EJB invoker servlets, secure the management console with
    strong authentication, disable deployment scanner in production, apply Red Hat security
    patches promptly, implement network segmentation, and monitor for deserialization exploit
    attempts targeting JBoss infrastructure.
