definition:
  what: "CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C projects that automates the integration of third-party libraries into Apple platform applications (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS). It hosts a centralized public spec repository containing metadata for over 90,000 libraries, resolves dependency graphs, and manages library compilation and linking through Xcode workspace integration."
  why: "CocoaPods is a significant supply chain attack vector for Apple platform development because it manages code dependencies that execute within applications distributed to millions of devices. Compromised CocoaPods packages can inject malicious code into iOS and macOS applications, potentially accessing sensitive device data, credentials, and user information. The centralized trunk server and spec repository represent single points of failure. Historical vulnerabilities in CocoaPods infrastructure have exposed the entire Apple developer ecosystem to supply chain attacks."
  how: "Developers define dependencies in a Podfile, then run pod install to resolve and download library source code. CocoaPods generates an Xcode workspace integrating the project with its dependencies. The CocoaPods Trunk server manages library publication and version registration. Podspec files describe each library's metadata, source location, and compilation requirements. The CDN-based spec repository distributes metadata without requiring full git clones. Pod authors authenticate via email-based session tokens to publish updates."
