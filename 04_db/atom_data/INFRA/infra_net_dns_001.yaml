definition:
  what: "A DNS System is the network infrastructure responsible for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses and providing other resource record lookups essential for internet and intranet communication. DNS systems consist of authoritative name servers that hold definitive records for domains, recursive resolvers that query on behalf of clients, caching servers that store recent query results to reduce latency, and forwarders that relay queries to upstream resolvers. DNS operates over UDP port 53 for standard queries and TCP port 53 for zone transfers and large responses, with DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) providing encrypted query channels. Enterprise DNS implementations such as Microsoft Active Directory DNS, BIND, Unbound, and cloud-based services like AWS Route 53 and Cloudflare DNS are foundational to network operation."
  why: "DNS is one of the most critical infrastructure services because virtually all network communication depends on name resolution. DNS failures or compromises can render entire networks and applications unusable. From a security perspective, DNS is a high-value target and attack vector exploited for reconnaissance through zone transfers and passive DNS analysis, data exfiltration through DNS tunneling, command-and-control communication through DNS beaconing, cache poisoning attacks to redirect traffic, and DNS hijacking to intercept credentials. DNS monitoring and security controls are essential components of any defense strategy."
  how: "When a client application needs to resolve a domain name, it sends a query to its configured DNS resolver. The resolver checks its cache for a recent answer. On a cache miss, the resolver performs iterative queries starting from the root name servers, proceeding through top-level domain servers to the authoritative name server for the target domain. The authoritative server responds with the requested resource record, which the resolver caches according to the TTL value and returns to the client. DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) provide authentication of DNS responses through cryptographic signatures. Enterprise DNS systems integrate with Active Directory, DHCP, and network access control systems to provide dynamic DNS registration and policy enforcement."
