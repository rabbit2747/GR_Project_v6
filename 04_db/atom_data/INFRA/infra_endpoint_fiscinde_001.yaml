# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    A fingerprint scanner input device is a biometric authentication peripheral that captures
    and processes fingerprint images for identity verification. These devices range from USB-
    connected desktop readers to integrated laptop sensors, standalone physical access terminals,
    and enterprise-grade multi-finger scanners. Common technologies include capacitive, optical,
    ultrasonic, and thermal sensors. In enterprise environments, fingerprint scanners integrate
    with Windows Hello, FIDO2, Active Directory, and physical access control systems for multi-
    factor authentication workflows.
  why: >-
    Fingerprint scanners are critical authentication infrastructure because they provide
    biometric identity verification that cannot be shared, forgotten, or easily stolen like
    passwords. However, biometric data breaches are irreversible since fingerprints cannot be
    changed. Security concerns include spoofing attacks using artificial fingerprints (gummy
    fingers, 3D-printed replicas), template database theft, man-in-the-middle attacks on
    scanner communication channels, and driver vulnerabilities. The 2015 OPM breach exposed
    5.6 million fingerprint records, demonstrating the catastrophic impact of biometric data loss.
  how: >-
    Fingerprint scanners capture a fingerprint image using capacitive, optical, or ultrasonic
    sensors, then extract minutiae points (ridge endings, bifurcations) to create a mathematical
    template. Match-on-device scanners perform comparison locally using a secure element,
    while match-on-server scanners transmit templates to a central authentication server. The
    scanner communicates with host systems via USB, Bluetooth, or network protocols. Enterprise
    integration uses Windows Biometric Framework (WBF), BioAPI, or proprietary SDKs. Template
    storage may use local secure enclaves (TPM), smart cards, or centralized biometric databases.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Biometric Template Security"
      value: "Fingerprint minutiae templates must be securely stored and transmitted since biometric data is immutable and cannot be reissued if compromised"
    - key: "Spoofing Resistance"
      value: "Liveness detection and anti-spoofing measures protect against artificial fingerprints, gummy fingers, and presentation attacks"
    - key: "Match-on-Device vs Match-on-Server"
      value: "Architectural choice between local comparison in secure elements and centralized server-side matching with different security trade-offs"

    Fingerprint Scanner Input Device is a biometric authentication peripheral that captures
    and processes fingerprint images for identity verification. Technologies include capacitive,
    optical, ultrasonic, and thermal sensors deployed as USB readers, laptop sensors, and
    enterprise access terminals. Integration with Windows Hello, FIDO2, Active Directory, and
    physical access control systems enables multi-factor authentication. Security concerns
    include spoofing with artificial fingerprints, biometric template database theft, driver
    vulnerabilities, and the irreversibility of biometric data breaches. The 2015 OPM breach
    exposed 5.6 million fingerprint records. Scanners use minutiae extraction for template
    creation with match-on-device or match-on-server architectures. Enterprise deployments
    use Windows Biometric Framework, BioAPI, or proprietary SDKs with template storage in
    TPMs, smart cards, or centralized databases.
