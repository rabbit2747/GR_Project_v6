# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    An electronic combination lock is a physical access control device that uses electronic
    circuitry to validate numeric, alphanumeric, or biometric credentials before releasing a
    locking mechanism. Modern electronic combination locks may include keypads, touchscreens,
    Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity, RFID/NFC readers, and integration with centralized access
    control systems. They are deployed on server room doors, network closets, data center
    cabinets, and sensitive facility entry points. Common enterprise-grade products include
    locks from Kaba, ASSA ABLOY, Dormakaba, and Allegion.
  why: >-
    Electronic combination locks are the physical security boundary protecting IT infrastructure
    from unauthorized physical access. Compromise of these locks through brute force, default
    codes, firmware vulnerabilities, or protocol weaknesses enables physical access to servers,
    network equipment, and sensitive areas. Physical access typically bypasses all logical
    security controls. Networked smart locks introduce additional attack vectors including
    Bluetooth replay attacks, Wi-Fi credential theft, API vulnerabilities, and cloud service
    compromise that can unlock doors remotely.
  how: >-
    Electronic combination locks operate by accepting credential input (keypad entry, RFID card,
    Bluetooth signal, or biometric scan), comparing it against stored authorized credentials in
    local memory or querying a centralized access control server, and actuating an electromechanical
    locking mechanism upon successful authentication. Audit trails record access attempts with
    timestamps and user IDs. Enterprise locks communicate with access control systems via
    Wiegand protocol, OSDP (Open Supervised Device Protocol), RS-485, or IP networking. Power
    is supplied via batteries, PoE, or hardwired connections with battery backup.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Physical-Cyber Security Boundary"
      value: "Electronic locks bridge physical and cybersecurity domains; their compromise enables bypassing all logical security controls through direct physical access"
    - key: "Access Control Integration"
      value: "Enterprise electronic locks integrate with centralized access control systems using Wiegand or OSDP protocols for unified identity and access management"
    - key: "Smart Lock Attack Surface"
      value: "Network-connected smart locks introduce Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, API, and cloud-based attack vectors beyond traditional lock bypass techniques"

    like ASSA ABLOY and Dormakaba maintain audit trails and support multi-factor authentication.
