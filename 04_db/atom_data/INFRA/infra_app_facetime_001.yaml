definition:
  what: >-
    FaceTime is Apple's proprietary video and audio calling application integrated into
    iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. It supports one-to-one and group calls with end-to-end encryption,
    using Apple's Push Notification Service (APNs) for call signaling and peer-to-peer or
    relay connections for media transport. FaceTime Links allow inviting non-Apple users
    through web browsers. The application is deeply integrated with the Apple ecosystem
    including Contacts, Messages, and Siri.
  why: >-
    FaceTime has had notable security vulnerabilities including a critical Group FaceTime
    bug (CVE-2019-6223) that allowed callers to eavesdrop on recipients before they answered.
    As a communication platform handling audio and video, FaceTime is a target for surveillance
    and eavesdropping. Its integration with Apple's notification and identity systems means
    compromising FaceTime can expose contact graphs and communication patterns. FaceTime's
    end-to-end encryption makes it attractive for both legitimate privacy and potential misuse
    as a covert communication channel.
  how: >-
    FaceTime establishes calls through Apple's infrastructure using APNs for signaling and
    STUN/TURN for NAT traversal. Media streams use SRTP with end-to-end encryption, with
    keys negotiated through Apple Identity Service (IDS). Call setup involves querying Apple
    servers to resolve Apple IDs and phone numbers to device push tokens. Group FaceTime
    uses a centralized relay architecture for multi-party calls. The application accesses
    device cameras, microphones, and contacts, requiring iOS/macOS permission grants.
    Exploitation targets the media processing stack, signaling protocol, or the underlying
    WebRTC-like media engine.

  embedding_text: >-
    FaceTime is Apple's proprietary video and audio calling application for iOS, iPadOS, and
    macOS, providing end-to-end encrypted communication using SRTP with keys negotiated through
    Apple Identity Service. It uses Apple Push Notifications for call signaling and STUN/TURN
    for NAT traversal. FaceTime had a critical Group FaceTime vulnerability (CVE-2019-6223)
    allowing eavesdropping before call answer. As a communication platform, it is a target for
    surveillance through media processing stack exploitation. Deep integration with Apple's
    notification and identity systems means compromise exposes contact graphs and communication
    patterns. FaceTime Links extend reach to non-Apple users through browsers. Security teams
    should ensure iOS/macOS devices running FaceTime are updated promptly and monitor for
    anomalous FaceTime usage patterns in enterprise environments.
