definition:
  what: >-
    A Database Service is a logical service abstraction that provides structured data storage,
    querying, and management capabilities to client applications through network-accessible
    interfaces. This encompasses both self-managed database instances running on dedicated
    servers and fully managed cloud database services such as Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database,
    Google Cloud SQL, and similar platforms. A database service encapsulates the DBMS engine,
    storage subsystem, networking, authentication, and management interfaces into a consumable
    service endpoint.
  why: >-
    Database services are foundational infrastructure that virtually all applications depend upon
    for persistent data storage. They represent critical points of failure and high-value
    targets because service disruption affects all dependent applications and data compromise
    exposes organizational assets. The shift toward managed database services introduces shared
    responsibility security models where the provider manages infrastructure security while
    customers manage data access, encryption keys, and application-level security controls.
  how: >-
    Database services expose network endpoints (IP:port or DNS-based) that accept connections
    from authorized clients using database wire protocols. Authentication verifies client
    identity through credentials, certificates, or token-based mechanisms. Authorization
    enforces access controls through database-level roles, schema permissions, and object
    grants. The service manages data persistence through the storage engine, provides query
    processing through the optimizer and execution engine, and maintains data consistency
    through transaction management. High availability is achieved through replication, failover
    clustering, or multi-zone deployment. Managed services additionally handle patching,
    backups, scaling, and monitoring.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Service Abstraction"
      value: >-
        A database service abstracts the underlying infrastructure complexity, presenting a
        network-accessible endpoint with defined SLAs for availability, performance, and
        durability regardless of the implementation details.
    - key: "Shared Responsibility Model"
      value: >-
        In managed database services, the cloud provider secures the infrastructure while
        customers are responsible for data classification, access controls, encryption
        configuration, and application-level security.
    - key: "High Availability"
      value: >-
        Database services implement redundancy through replication, automatic failover, and
        multi-zone deployment to maintain data availability despite hardware or software failures.

    A Database Service is a logical service abstraction providing structured data storage,

    self-managed database instances and fully managed cloud services like Amazon RDS, Azure SQL
    Database, and Google Cloud SQL. Database services expose network endpoints accepting
    authenticated client connections using database wire protocols. They enforce authorization
    through roles and grants, manage persistence through storage engines, process queries, and
    maintain consistency through transaction management. High availability is achieved via
    replication and failover. Managed services introduce shared responsibility models where
    providers handle infrastructure security while customers manage data access and encryption.
    Database services are foundational infrastructure and high-value targets whose compromise
    affects all dependent applications and can expose organizational data assets.
