definition:
  what: >-
    Kometa Browser is a Chromium-based web browser primarily targeting Russian-speaking users.
    It is developed by Mail.ru Group (VK) and integrates with Russian internet services. Like
    other Chromium-based browsers, it stores user credentials, cookies, and browsing data in
    SQLite databases using the Chromium profile format. The browser has limited distribution
    outside of Russian-speaking markets.
  why: >-
    Kometa Browser is specifically targeted by infostealer malware families that harvest
    credentials from Chromium-based browsers. Infostealers like RedLine, Raccoon, and Vidar
    include Kometa in their browser targeting lists, extracting saved passwords, cookies,
    autofill data, and cryptocurrency wallet extensions. As a less-maintained Chromium fork,
    Kometa may lag behind security patches for the underlying Chromium engine, exposing users
    to known vulnerabilities. Its distribution through bundleware has raised PUP (Potentially
    Unwanted Program) concerns.
  how: >-
    Kometa Browser uses the Chromium rendering engine and stores data in the standard Chromium
    profile format. Credentials are stored in the Login Data SQLite database encrypted with
    DPAPI on Windows. Cookies, browsing history, and autofill data reside in additional SQLite
    databases within the user profile directory. Infostealer malware targets these profile
    databases at known filesystem paths, decrypting credentials using the Windows DPAPI
    encryption key. The browser's Chromium base means it shares the same credential storage
    format as Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium browsers.

    Kometa Browser is a Chromium-based web browser targeting Russian-speaking users, developed
    by Mail.ru Group. It uses standard Chromium credential storage format with DPAPI-encrypted
    Login Data SQLite databases. Kometa is specifically targeted by infostealer malware families
    including RedLine, Raccoon, and Vidar for credential, cookie, and autofill data harvesting.
    As a less-maintained Chromium fork, it may lag behind upstream security patches. Its
    distribution through bundleware raises PUP concerns. Security teams should identify Kometa
    installations, ensure organizational browsers are limited to supported options, and monitor
    for infostealer activity targeting browser profile directories.
