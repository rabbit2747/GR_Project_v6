definition:
  what: >-
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is Google's comprehensive cloud infrastructure platform
    encompassing compute (Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions), storage (Cloud
    Storage, Persistent Disk, Filestore), networking (VPC, Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud CDN,
    Cloud Interconnect), data analytics (BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub), AI/ML (Vertex AI),
    and security services (Security Command Center, Chronicle, BeyondCorp). GCP operates
    across 40+ regions with a software-defined networking backbone.
  why: >-
    As a top-tier cloud provider hosting critical enterprise workloads, GCP is a prime target
    for sophisticated attacks. Attack vectors include IAM policy exploitation, service account
    impersonation chains, organization-level privilege escalation, Cloud Storage bucket
    enumeration, VPC firewall misconfiguration, and cross-project lateral movement. GCP's
    unique architecture using projects and organization hierarchy creates specific security
    challenges around resource organization and policy inheritance.
  how: >-
    GCP uses a resource hierarchy of Organization, Folders, and Projects with IAM policies
    inherited downward. VPC networks are global with regional subnets. Identity management
    uses Cloud Identity with Workload Identity Federation for external identity providers.
    Security Command Center provides continuous security posture management. Chronicle SIEM
    provides threat detection with Google-scale data analytics. BeyondCorp Enterprise implements
    zero-trust access. Cloud Armor provides DDoS protection and WAF. VPC Service Controls
    create security perimeters around GCP resources.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Resource Hierarchy and Policy Inheritance"
      value: "Organization > Folders > Projects hierarchy with IAM policies inherited downward, enabling centralized governance but risking over-permissive inheritance"
    - key: "VPC Service Controls"
      value: "Security perimeters that restrict data movement between GCP services and projects, preventing data exfiltration even with valid IAM credentials"
    - key: "BeyondCorp Zero Trust"
      value: "Google's zero-trust access model that eliminates VPN dependencies by enforcing device trust, identity verification, and context-aware access policies"
