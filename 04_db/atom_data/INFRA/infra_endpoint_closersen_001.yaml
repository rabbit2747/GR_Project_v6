definition:
  what: >-
    A Cloud Service Sensor is a lightweight agent or virtual appliance deployed within cloud
    environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) to collect telemetry data about cloud service configurations,
    resource utilization, network traffic, and security events. These sensors monitor cloud
    workloads including virtual machines, containers, serverless functions, and managed services,
    reporting status and anomalies to centralized cloud security platforms such as CSPM, CWPP,
    and CNAPP solutions.
  why: >-
    Cloud environments introduce shared responsibility models where organizations must monitor
    their portion of the security stack. Cloud service sensors provide the foundational visibility
    required to detect misconfigurations, unauthorized access, data exfiltration, lateral movement,
    and compliance violations across multi-cloud and hybrid deployments. Without sensor telemetry,
    security teams operate blind to cloud-specific threats and configuration drift.
  how: >-
    Cloud service sensors operate by deploying lightweight agents on cloud workloads or leveraging
    agentless API-based collection from cloud provider management planes. They gather metrics
    including CPU, memory, network flow data, storage access patterns, IAM activity, and
    configuration state. Data is normalized and forwarded to centralized analytics platforms
    via encrypted channels. Sensors may use cloud-native APIs (CloudTrail, Azure Monitor,
    GCP Cloud Logging) or custom instrumentation for deeper workload visibility.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Cloud Telemetry Collection"
      value: "Gathering configuration state, performance metrics, and security events from cloud resources using agents or API-based polling"
    - key: "Multi-Cloud Visibility"
      value: "Providing unified monitoring across AWS, Azure, GCP, and hybrid environments through normalized telemetry data"
    - key: "Agentless vs Agent-Based"
      value: "Two deployment models: API-based agentless scanning for configuration and agent-based for deep workload runtime monitoring"
