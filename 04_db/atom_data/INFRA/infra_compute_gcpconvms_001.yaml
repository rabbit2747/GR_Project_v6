definition:
  what: >-
    GCP Confidential VMs provide hardware-based memory encryption for virtual machine instances
    using AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) or Intel TDX (Trust Domain Extensions)
    technology. Confidential VMs encrypt data in use (in memory) so that the cloud provider
    and hypervisor cannot access VM memory contents in plaintext. This provides a hardware-rooted
    trust boundary that protects sensitive workloads even from privileged infrastructure
    compromise.
  why: >-
    Confidential VMs address the threat of data exposure from compromised hypervisors, malicious
    cloud insiders, or physical infrastructure attacks. Traditional VMs rely on trusting the
    cloud provider's hypervisor and infrastructure. Confidential computing reduces this trust
    requirement by encrypting memory with hardware keys inaccessible to the provider. This is
    critical for processing sensitive data including PII, financial records, healthcare data,
    and cryptographic key material in cloud environments.
  how: >-
    Confidential VMs use AMD SEV-SNP or Intel TDX processors to encrypt VM memory with
    per-VM encryption keys managed by the CPU hardware. The hypervisor cannot decrypt VM memory.
    Remote attestation verifies the VM is running on genuine confidential computing hardware
    with expected firmware. Confidential VMs integrate with GCP's virtual TPM for measured boot
    and integrity monitoring. They work with standard GCP services including load balancers,
    Cloud KMS, and Assured Workloads for regulated environments.

  embedding_text: >-
    GCP Confidential VMs provide hardware-based memory encryption using AMD SEV-SNP or Intel
    TDX, encrypting data in use so the cloud provider and hypervisor cannot access VM memory
    in plaintext. This addresses threats from compromised hypervisors, malicious insiders, and
    physical attacks. Remote attestation verifies genuine confidential computing hardware.
    Critical for processing PII, financial data, and cryptographic keys in cloud. Integrates
    with virtual TPM for measured boot and works with Assured Workloads for regulated
    environments. Alternative to AWS Nitro Enclaves and Azure Confidential Computing.
