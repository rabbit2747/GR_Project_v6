definition:
  what: >-
    Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the core compute service of AWS that provides
    resizable virtual machine instances in the cloud. EC2 offers a wide selection of instance
    types optimized for different workloads (general purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized,
    GPU). Instances run on the Nitro hypervisor and are launched from Amazon Machine Images
    (AMIs) within VPCs. EC2 is the foundational compute primitive for AWS-hosted applications.
  why: >-
    EC2 instances are the primary compute workload in AWS and a major attack target. Security
    concerns include exposed instances with public IPs, overly permissive security groups,
    instance metadata credential theft via SSRF, compromised AMIs, and IAM role abuse. EC2
    instances require hardening through IMDSv2 enforcement, security group least-privilege,
    EBS encryption, Systems Manager patching, and VPC network isolation.
  how: >-
    EC2 instances are launched from AMIs specifying OS, software, and configuration. They run
    in VPC subnets with security groups controlling network access. Instance metadata provides
    IAM role credentials via the IMDS endpoint. Storage includes instance store (ephemeral)
    and EBS volumes (persistent). Auto Scaling groups manage fleet capacity. EC2 Instance
    Connect and Systems Manager provide secure remote access. CloudWatch monitors performance
    and GuardDuty detects threats.

    running on the Nitro hypervisor, launched from AMIs within VPCs. Security concerns include
    exposed instances, permissive security groups, IMDS credential theft via SSRF, compromised

    Manager for patching, Instance Connect for secure access, and CloudWatch/GuardDuty for
    monitoring and threat detection.
