definition:
  what: >-
    Adobe Flash Player was a browser plugin and standalone runtime for executing SWF (Shockwave
    Flash) multimedia content including animations, games, video players, and rich internet
    applications. Flash Player included the ActionScript virtual machine, a JIT compiler, and
    media codecs. Adobe officially ended Flash Player support on December 31, 2020, and blocked
    Flash content from running in January 2021. Major browsers removed Flash support entirely.
  why: >-
    Flash Player was historically one of the most exploited software components in cybersecurity,
    with hundreds of critical vulnerabilities including use-after-free, buffer overflow, type
    confusion, and integer overflow flaws enabling remote code execution. It was a primary vector
    for drive-by download attacks, exploit kits (Angler, Magnitude, RIG), and targeted APT
    campaigns. Despite being end-of-life, legacy Flash Player installations remain on some
    enterprise systems, and historical Flash vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-4878, CVE-2015-5119)
    are studied as canonical examples of browser plugin exploitation.
  how: >-
    Flash Player operated as a browser plugin (NPAPI/PPAPI) or ActiveX control that loaded and
    executed SWF files containing ActionScript bytecode, vector graphics, and embedded media.
    The ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM2) executed bytecode with JIT compilation. Exploitation
    leveraged memory corruption vulnerabilities in the SWF parser, ActionScript VM, or media
    codecs to achieve arbitrary code execution. Exploit kits delivered malicious SWF files
    through compromised websites or malvertising, exploiting Flash in the browser sandbox.
    Some exploits chained Flash vulnerabilities with browser sandbox escapes for full system
    compromise.

    Adobe Flash Player was a browser plugin and runtime for executing SWF multimedia content
    that was officially discontinued in December 2020. Flash Player was historically one of the
    most exploited software components with hundreds of critical RCE vulnerabilities including
    use-after-free, buffer overflow, and type confusion flaws. It was the primary vector for
    drive-by download attacks and exploit kits including Angler, Magnitude, and RIG. The
    ActionScript Virtual Machine with JIT compilation and SWF parser were common exploitation
    targets. Despite end-of-life, legacy Flash installations may persist on enterprise systems.
    Historical Flash vulnerabilities are canonical examples of browser plugin exploitation in
    cybersecurity education. Security teams should ensure complete removal of Flash Player from
    all systems and block SWF file execution at network boundaries.
