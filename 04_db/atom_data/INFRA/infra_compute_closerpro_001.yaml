definition:
  what: >-
    A Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is an organization that offers cloud computing services
    including infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and software (SaaS) capabilities
    delivered over the internet. Major CSPs include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure,
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and smaller providers like DigitalOcean and Oracle Cloud.
    CSPs operate globally distributed data centers and manage the physical infrastructure,
    networking, and foundational security that underpins customer workloads.
  why: >-
    Cloud service providers define the security baseline for all hosted workloads through the
    shared responsibility model. Understanding CSP security capabilities, compliance
    certifications, incident response processes, and data handling practices is essential for
    risk assessment. CSP-level vulnerabilities or misconfigurations can impact all tenants.
    Multi-cloud strategies introduce additional complexity in security policy consistency
    and identity management across providers.
  how: >-
    CSPs deliver services through globally distributed regions and availability zones. They
    provide management consoles, APIs, CLIs, and SDKs for resource provisioning. Security
    is delivered through IAM services, encryption at rest and in transit, network isolation,
    logging and monitoring, and compliance certification programs (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP).
    CSPs maintain physical security, hypervisor security, and network infrastructure while
    customers manage their applications, data, and access controls.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Shared Responsibility Model"
      value: "Division of security responsibilities between the CSP (infrastructure security) and customer (workload security, data protection, access control)"
    - key: "Service Models"
      value: "IaaS provides virtual infrastructure, PaaS provides development platforms, SaaS provides complete applications, each with different security boundaries"
    - key: "Compliance Certifications"
      value: "CSPs maintain certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, HIPAA) that customers inherit for their compliance frameworks"
