definition:
  what: >-
    PayPal is a global online payment platform enabling digital payments, money transfers, and
    e-commerce checkout services. It provides REST APIs for merchant integration, payment
    processing, invoicing, and subscription management. PayPal supports multiple authentication
    methods including OAuth 2.0 for API access and multi-factor authentication for user accounts.
    The platform processes billions of transactions annually and stores sensitive financial data
    including payment methods, bank accounts, and transaction histories.
  why: >-
    PayPal is one of the most impersonated brands in phishing campaigns globally due to its
    financial nature and widespread user base. Phishing attacks create fake PayPal login pages,
    payment notifications, and account limitation alerts to harvest credentials and financial
    information. PayPal accounts are primary targets for credential stuffing attacks using
    breached credentials from other services. Infostealer malware specifically targets PayPal
    session cookies and saved credentials in browsers. PayPal API credentials (client ID/secret)
    leaked in code repositories enable unauthorized payment processing. Account takeover enables
    fraudulent transactions and money laundering. PayPal's dispute resolution system is exploited
    for social engineering fraud.
  how: >-
    PayPal operates as a web and mobile application with REST APIs for merchant integration.
    Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 tokens for API access and session-based authentication for
    user interfaces. Phishing campaigns distribute fake PayPal emails with links to credential
    harvesting pages mimicking PayPal's login interface. Credential stuffing attacks attempt
    automated login with breached username/password combinations. Infostealer malware extracts
    PayPal session cookies from browsers to hijack authenticated sessions. API credential abuse
    uses leaked client ID/secret pairs for unauthorized payment operations. Social engineering
    exploits PayPal's buyer protection system for refund fraud. Business Email Compromise (BEC)
    campaigns impersonate PayPal invoices for financial fraud.

    PayPal is a global online payment platform enabling digital payments, money transfers, and
    e-commerce checkout with REST APIs for merchant integration. PayPal is among the most
    impersonated brands in phishing campaigns globally, with fake login pages and payment
    notification emails harvesting credentials and financial information. Accounts are targeted
    by credential stuffing using breached credentials and infostealer malware extracting session
    cookies from browsers. API credentials leaked in code repositories enable unauthorized
    payment processing. Account takeover enables fraudulent transactions and money laundering.
    Business Email Compromise campaigns impersonate PayPal invoices for financial fraud.
    Security teams should implement phishing awareness training for PayPal impersonation,
    enforce MFA on PayPal accounts, monitor for credential stuffing patterns, rotate API
    credentials regularly, and detect infostealer activity targeting PayPal session data.
