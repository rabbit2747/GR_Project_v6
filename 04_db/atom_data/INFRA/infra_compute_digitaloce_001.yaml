  what: >-
    DigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure provider targeting developers and small-to-medium
    businesses with simplified cloud services including Droplets (virtual machines), Kubernetes
    (DOKS), managed databases, object storage (Spaces), App Platform (PaaS), and Functions
    (serverless). DigitalOcean focuses on developer experience and simplicity compared to the
    complexity of AWS, Azure, and GCP, operating across multiple global data center regions.
  why: >-
    DigitalOcean hosts significant numbers of developer projects, startups, and small business
    infrastructure. Its simpler security model means organizations may lack the advanced security
    tooling available in larger cloud providers. DigitalOcean Droplets are frequently used for
    hosting C2 servers, phishing infrastructure, and scanning operations due to their low cost
    and easy provisioning. Understanding DigitalOcean security features is essential for both
    defenders protecting hosted workloads and analysts tracking threat infrastructure.
  how: >-
    DigitalOcean resources are provisioned through the web control panel, API, CLI (doctl), or
    Terraform provider. Droplets run on KVM hypervisors with VPC networking. Cloud firewalls
    provide network filtering. IAM is managed through teams and project-based access. Monitoring
    is via built-in metrics and alerting. Security features include VPC, cloud firewalls,
    SSH key authentication, two-factor authentication, and Spaces (S3-compatible) with access
    controls. DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) provides managed Kubernetes clusters.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Developer-Focused Simplicity"
      value: "Simplified cloud services with streamlined interfaces targeting developers and SMBs rather than enterprise complexity"
    - key: "Droplets"
      value: "Linux-based virtual machines running on KVM hypervisors that form the primary compute primitive on DigitalOcean"
    - key: "Threat Infrastructure Hosting"
      value: "Low cost and easy provisioning make DigitalOcean a common platform for hosting adversary infrastructure including C2 and phishing"
