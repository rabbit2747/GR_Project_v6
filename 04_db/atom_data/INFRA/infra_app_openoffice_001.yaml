definition:
  what: >-
    Apache OpenOffice is a free, open-source office productivity suite maintained by the Apache
    Software Foundation. It includes Writer (word processing), Calc (spreadsheets), Impress
    (presentations), Draw (vector graphics), Base (databases), and Math (formula editor).
    OpenOffice supports ODF and Microsoft Office formats and includes a macro system based on
    StarBasic. Originally developed as StarOffice by Sun Microsystems, it was the predecessor
    to LibreOffice, which forked in 2010. OpenOffice has significantly slower development
    activity compared to LibreOffice.
  why: >-
    OpenOffice presents security risks as an office suite with declining maintenance and slower
    security patch cadence compared to its LibreOffice fork. Like other office suites, OpenOffice
    processes complex document formats that can contain embedded macros, OLE objects, and external
    links creating exploitation vectors. The StarBasic macro engine can execute system commands
    and access the filesystem. OpenOffice's slower development cycle means vulnerabilities may
    remain unpatched longer than in LibreOffice. Crafted documents exploiting format parser
    vulnerabilities or macro execution bypasses can achieve code execution on systems running
    OpenOffice. Legacy installations may lack modern security mitigations.
  how: >-
    OpenOffice processes documents through format-specific parsers handling ODF, OOXML, RTF, and
    legacy formats. The StarBasic macro engine executes scripts embedded in documents with
    configurable security levels (disabled, medium with prompt, low). OLE objects and external
    links can reference system resources. Document processing vulnerabilities target format
    parsers for memory corruption and macro security bypasses for code execution without user
    consent. Phishing campaigns deliver crafted documents with malicious macros targeting
    OpenOffice users. The application's large C++ codebase and complex format parsing create
    opportunities for buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities.

    Apache OpenOffice is a free open-source office productivity suite maintained by the Apache
    Software Foundation, the predecessor to LibreOffice. It includes Writer, Calc, Impress, and
    supports ODF and Microsoft Office formats with a StarBasic macro engine. OpenOffice presents
    security risks due to declining development activity and slower security patch cadence compared
    to LibreOffice. It processes complex document formats with embedded macros, OLE objects, and
    external links creating exploitation vectors. The StarBasic engine can execute system commands
    with configurable security levels vulnerable to bypass. Format parser vulnerabilities enable
    memory corruption through crafted documents. Security teams should migrate to actively
    maintained alternatives like LibreOffice, disable macros by default, restrict document
    processing to trusted sources, and monitor for exploitation of known OpenOffice vulnerabilities.
