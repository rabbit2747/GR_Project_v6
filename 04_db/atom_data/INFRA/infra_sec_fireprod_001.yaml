# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    A Firewall Product is a network security system implemented as hardware, software, or cloud
    service that monitors and controls network traffic based on security rules. Modern NGFWs
    combine packet filtering with deep packet inspection, application awareness, IPS, TLS
    inspection, URL filtering, and threat intelligence. Major vendors include Palo Alto, Fortinet,
    Check Point, Cisco, and Juniper Networks.
  why: >-
    Firewalls are the fundamental network security control between zones of different trust
    levels. They are also high-value attack targets: recent critical vulnerabilities in PAN-OS,
    FortiOS, and Cisco ASA have been actively exploited by threat actors for initial access.
  how: >-
    Firewalls inspect packets against rule bases defining allowed and denied traffic. Stateful
    firewalls track connection state. NGFWs add App-ID, user identity, TLS decryption, IPS,
    URL categorization, and sandboxing. Deployed at perimeters and between zones with HA
    clustering. Management uses centralized platforms with change tracking.

    Firewall Product is a network security system that monitors and controls traffic based on
    security rules. Modern NGFWs combine packet filtering with DPI, application awareness, IPS,
    TLS inspection, and threat intelligence. Major vendors include Palo Alto, Fortinet, Check
    Point, and Cisco. Firewalls are both fundamental security controls and high-value attack
    targets with actively exploited vulnerabilities in PAN-OS, FortiOS, and Cisco ASA.
