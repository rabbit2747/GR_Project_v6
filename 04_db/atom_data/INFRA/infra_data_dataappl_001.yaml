definition:
  what: >-
    A Database Application is a software application that interacts with one or more database
    management systems to store, retrieve, manipulate, and present data. This includes both
    database administration tools (such as phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, SQL Server
    Management Studio, and DBeaver) and business applications with embedded database connectivity.
    Database applications serve as the interface layer between users or automated processes and
    the underlying database engines.
  why: >-
    Database applications are critical from a security perspective because they represent the
    primary access path to stored data. They implement application-level authentication, query
    construction, and data presentation logic. Vulnerabilities in database applications,
    particularly SQL injection flaws, are among the most exploited attack vectors in web
    security. Database administration tools present additional risk as they provide direct,
    often privileged access to database engines and may be exposed to unauthorized users
    through misconfiguration.
  how: >-
    Database applications connect to database servers using database drivers or connectors
    (JDBC, ODBC, native drivers) with connection strings specifying host, port, credentials,
    and database name. They construct and execute SQL or NoSQL queries, process result sets,
    and present data to users or downstream systems. Security controls include parameterized
    queries to prevent SQL injection, connection pooling with least-privilege credentials,
    input validation, output encoding, and audit logging of data access operations.
    Authentication may be delegated to the database engine or managed at the application layer.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "SQL Injection Risk"
      value: >-
        Database applications that construct queries using string concatenation with user input
        are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, which remain one of the most critical and
        prevalent web application vulnerabilities.
    - key: "Database Driver Layer"
      value: >-
        Applications connect through database-specific drivers (JDBC, ODBC, ADO.NET) that
        handle protocol negotiation, authentication, query transmission, and result set parsing.
    - key: "Least-Privilege Database Access"
      value: >-
        Database applications should use dedicated service accounts with minimal required
        permissions rather than administrative credentials, limiting blast radius if compromised.
