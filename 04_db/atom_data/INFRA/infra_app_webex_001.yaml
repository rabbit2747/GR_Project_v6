definition:
  what: >-
    Cisco Webex is an enterprise video conferencing, messaging, and collaboration platform
    providing meetings, calling, messaging, events, and whiteboarding capabilities. Available
    as desktop applications, mobile apps, and web browser access, it supports end-to-end
    encrypted meetings, screen sharing, recording, and integration with enterprise tools.
    Webex serves millions of enterprise users for internal and external communication with
    features including breakout rooms, real-time translation, and meeting compliance recording.
  why: >-
    Webex desktop clients have had critical vulnerabilities including DLL injection, local
    privilege escalation, and remote code execution flaws. Meeting recordings stored in cloud
    or local storage may contain sensitive business information. Meeting links can be targeted
    for unauthorized access (meeting bombing) if not properly secured with passwords and
    waiting rooms. The Webex client runs with user-level permissions but vulnerabilities have
    enabled escalation. Compromised Webex accounts provide access to meeting recordings,
    chat histories, and shared files containing confidential business data.
  how: >-
    Webex operates through cloud infrastructure with data centers globally. Desktop clients
    (Windows, macOS, Linux) connect via HTTPS and use media protocols (SRTP for audio/video)
    with end-to-end encryption options. Authentication integrates with SAML/SSO providers
    and supports MFA. Meetings use unique IDs with optional passwords and Personal Room
    functionality. The platform provides REST APIs for administration, compliance, and
    integration. Recordings are stored in Webex cloud or exported locally. The Webex client
    uses local services for meeting join optimization and device discovery.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Client-Side Vulnerabilities"
      value: "Webex desktop client has had DLL injection, privilege escalation, and RCE vulnerabilities enabling local compromise through the collaboration tool"
    - key: "Meeting Data Sensitivity"
      value: "Meeting recordings, chat histories, and shared files contain sensitive business communications accessible through compromised accounts"
    - key: "Meeting Security Controls"
      value: "Insufficient meeting security (no passwords, no waiting rooms) enables unauthorized access to meetings containing confidential discussions"

  embedding_text: >-
    Cisco Webex is an enterprise video conferencing and collaboration platform with desktop,
    mobile, and web clients supporting E2E encrypted meetings, messaging, and file sharing.
    Security concerns include desktop client vulnerabilities (DLL injection, privilege
    escalation, RCE), meeting recording exposure containing sensitive business data, meeting
    bombing through unsecured meeting links, and account compromise providing access to
    communication histories. The platform integrates with SAML/SSO and supports MFA. Security
    teams should keep Webex clients updated, enforce meeting passwords and waiting rooms,
    manage recording storage and access controls, implement SSO with MFA, and monitor for
    anomalous meeting access patterns.
