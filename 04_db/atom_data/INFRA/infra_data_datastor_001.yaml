definition:
  what: >-
    A Data Store is the broadest abstraction for any system, service, or mechanism that persists
    data for later retrieval. This encompasses relational databases, NoSQL databases, key-value
    stores, object storage, file systems, message queues, caches, data lakes, and any other
    technology that provides durable or semi-durable data persistence. A data store may be
    implemented as software, hardware, cloud services, or combinations thereof. It is the
    foundational concept from which all specific data storage technologies derive.
  why: >-
    Data stores are the ultimate targets of most cyberattacks because they contain the
    organization's valuable information assets: customer data, financial records, intellectual
    property, credentials, and operational data. Understanding data stores as an abstract
    category is essential for threat modeling because security controls must be applied
    regardless of the specific storage technology. Data classification, access controls,
    encryption, backup, and monitoring requirements apply universally to all data stores.
  how: >-
    Data stores implement persistence through various mechanisms: disk-based storage (HDD/SSD),
    in-memory storage with persistence (Redis AOF/RDB), distributed storage across nodes
    (Cassandra, HDFS), or cloud-managed storage (S3, GCS). Access is controlled through
    authentication (verifying identity), authorization (enforcing permissions), and accounting
    (audit logging). Data protection includes encryption at rest, encryption in transit, backup
    and recovery, replication for durability, and data lifecycle management. Network access
    is restricted through segmentation, firewalls, and service-level access controls.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Data at Rest Protection"
      value: >-
        All data stores require encryption at rest to protect against unauthorized access
        to storage media, whether through physical theft, unauthorized administrative access,
        or backup compromise.
    - key: "Access Control Universality"
      value: >-
        Regardless of implementation technology, all data stores must implement authentication,
        authorization, and audit logging to control and track data access.
    - key: "Data Classification"
      value: >-
        Data stores must be classified based on the sensitivity of contained data to determine
        appropriate security controls, retention policies, and compliance requirements.
    - key: "Backup and Recovery"
      value: >-
        All data stores require backup strategies that ensure data can be recovered from
        accidental deletion, corruption, ransomware, or disaster scenarios.

    A Data Store is the broadest abstraction for any system or mechanism that persists data for

    disk-based storage, in-memory with persistence, distributed storage, or cloud-managed
    storage. Data stores are the foundational concept from which all specific data storage
    technologies derive, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK T1005 (Data from Local System) as primary
    collection targets.
