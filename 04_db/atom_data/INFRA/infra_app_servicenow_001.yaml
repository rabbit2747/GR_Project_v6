# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    ServiceNow is a cloud-based enterprise platform providing IT Service Management (ITSM),
    IT Operations Management (ITOM), Security Operations (SecOps), and workflow automation.
    The NOW Platform serves as a central hub for enterprise operations including incident
    management, change management, CMDB, vulnerability response, and business process
    automation. It is widely deployed across Fortune 500 companies and government agencies
    as a critical operational platform.
  why: >-
    ServiceNow instances contain highly sensitive enterprise data including complete IT asset
    inventories (CMDB), vulnerability scan results, security incident details, network
    configurations, and employee information. Compromised ServiceNow instances provide
    attackers with comprehensive reconnaissance data about the target environment. The
    platform's REST API and scripting capabilities (Glide) can be exploited for data
    exfiltration. Misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs) have led to mass data exposure
    incidents. ServiceNow's integration with identity providers, SIEM, and vulnerability
    scanners creates a rich target for supply chain attacks.
  how: >-
    ServiceNow operates as a multi-tenant SaaS platform hosted on ServiceNow's cloud
    infrastructure. Authentication integrates with SAML/SSO identity providers, LDAP, and
    OAuth. The platform uses a JavaScript-based scripting engine (Glide) for customization
    and automation. REST and SOAP APIs enable integration with external systems. Access
    control is managed through ACLs, roles, and domain separation for multi-tenant
    deployments. Data is stored in a relational database with the CMDB providing a
    centralized configuration item repository.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Enterprise Data Consolidation"
      value: "ServiceNow CMDB and ITSM consolidate asset inventories, vulnerability data, and security incidents into a single platform, creating a high-value intelligence target"
    - key: "ACL Misconfiguration Risk"
      value: "Improperly configured Access Control Lists can expose sensitive CMDB data, vulnerability reports, and security incidents to unauthorized users or public access"
    - key: "API and Scripting Attack Surface"
      value: "REST APIs, Glide scripting engine, and extensive integration capabilities create multiple attack vectors for data access and code execution"

  embedding_text: >-
    ServiceNow is a cloud-based enterprise platform providing ITSM, ITOM, SecOps, and
    workflow automation for Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. The NOW Platform
    consolidates CMDB asset inventories, vulnerability scan results, security incidents, and
    network configurations. Security concerns include sensitive data exposure through ACL
    misconfigurations, REST API exploitation for data exfiltration, Glide scripting engine
    abuse, and supply chain risks through integrations with identity providers, SIEM, and
    vulnerability scanners. Authentication integrates with SAML/SSO and LDAP. Security teams
    should audit ACL configurations, restrict API access, monitor scripting activity, enforce
    least-privilege roles, and review integration credentials to protect ServiceNow instances.
