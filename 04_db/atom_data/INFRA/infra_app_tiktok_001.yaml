# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    TikTok is a short-form video social media platform developed by ByteDance, available as
    a mobile application for iOS and Android and as a web platform. It enables users to create,
    share, and discover short videos with music, filters, and effects. The platform uses
    algorithmic content recommendation, collects extensive user behavioral data, and has over
    one billion monthly active users worldwide, making it one of the most widely used social
    media applications.
  why: >-
    TikTok presents significant security and privacy concerns including extensive data collection
    (device identifiers, location, browsing history, biometric data, clipboard content), potential
    data access by Chinese government entities under China's national security laws, and use
    as a platform for social engineering and disinformation campaigns. The app has been banned
    on government devices in multiple countries. TikTok's in-app browser has been found to
    inject JavaScript for keystroke monitoring. The platform is used for phishing link
    distribution, credential harvesting through fake login pages, and targeting of specific
    user demographics for intelligence collection.
  how: >-
    TikTok operates through native mobile applications and a web interface, with content
    delivery through CDN infrastructure. The app collects device data including hardware
    identifiers, IP addresses, GPS location, installed apps, and network information. An
    algorithmic recommendation engine analyzes user behavior to serve personalized content.
    The in-app browser processes external links within the TikTok context. APIs enable
    third-party integrations and data access. Content moderation and data processing involve
    backend infrastructure spanning multiple jurisdictions with varying data protection
    standards.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Extensive Data Collection"
      value: "Collects device identifiers, location data, browsing history, biometric information, clipboard content, and behavioral patterns beyond core functionality requirements"
    - key: "Data Sovereignty Concerns"
      value: "ByteDance ownership and Chinese national security laws raise concerns about potential government access to user data collected globally"
    - key: "In-App Browser Monitoring"
      value: "TikTok in-app browser has been found to inject JavaScript capable of monitoring keystrokes and form inputs on external websites"

    TikTok is a ByteDance short-form video platform with over one billion monthly users. It
    collects extensive data including device identifiers, location, browsing history, biometric
    data, and clipboard content. Security concerns include potential Chinese government data
    access under national security laws, in-app browser JavaScript injection for keystroke
    monitoring, platform use for social engineering and phishing campaigns, and disinformation
    distribution. TikTok has been banned on government devices in multiple countries. The
    algorithmic recommendation engine analyzes behavioral data extensively. Security teams
    should restrict TikTok on corporate devices through MDM policies, implement network-level
    blocking where appropriate, and educate users about data collection risks and social
    engineering threats through the platform.
