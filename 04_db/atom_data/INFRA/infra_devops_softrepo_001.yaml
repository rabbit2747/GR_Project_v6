definition:
  what: "Software Repository is the general infrastructure category for centralized hosting services that store, index, and distribute software packages for specific programming language ecosystems or platform communities. This includes PyPI (Python), npm (Node.js), NuGet (.NET), RubyGems (Ruby), CocoaPods (iOS/macOS), Maven Central (Java), and crates.io (Rust). Repositories provide package discovery, versioning, dependency metadata, download distribution, and author management."
  why: "Software repositories are prime targets for supply chain attacks because they serve as trusted sources of code that developers incorporate into applications. Package repositories have been exploited through typosquatting (similar package names), dependency confusion (internal vs. public name conflicts), account hijacking, and direct repository infrastructure compromise. Malicious packages in public repositories can propagate to thousands of downstream applications. Repository security directly impacts the integrity of the entire software supply chain."
  how: "Software repositories operate as centralized indexing and hosting services. Package authors authenticate and upload packages containing code, metadata, and dependency declarations. Package managers on developer machines query the repository API, resolve dependency trees, download packages, and verify integrity. Repositories maintain version indexes, download statistics, and author ownership records. Security features include package signing, two-factor authentication for publishers, vulnerability advisories, and automated malware scanning. Mirror and proxy configurations enable private repository hosting."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Package Index"
      value: "Searchable catalog of available packages with metadata including versions, dependencies, authors, and download statistics"
    - key: "Dependency Resolution"
      value: "Algorithm that computes a compatible set of package versions satisfying all declared dependency constraints"
    - key: "Package Publishing"
      value: "Authenticated process of uploading new package versions with metadata to the repository for public or private consumption"
