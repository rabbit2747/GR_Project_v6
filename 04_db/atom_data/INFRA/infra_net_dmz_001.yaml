definition:
  what: "A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a physical or logical network segment that sits between an organization's internal trusted network and an external untrusted network such as the internet. The DMZ hosts public-facing services including web servers, mail relays, DNS servers, reverse proxies, and VPN concentrators, isolating them from the internal network through firewall rules and access control lists. Traffic from the external network can reach DMZ-hosted services but cannot directly access the internal network, while internal network traffic can reach the DMZ and external networks subject to security policy. The DMZ architecture typically employs a dual-firewall design or a single firewall with three or more interfaces separating external, DMZ, and internal zones."
  why: "The DMZ is a foundational network security architecture that provides defense in depth by creating a buffer zone between untrusted external networks and the trusted internal network. By placing public-facing services in the DMZ, organizations limit the blast radius of a compromise since an attacker who gains access to a DMZ-hosted server still faces additional firewall barriers before reaching internal resources. The DMZ enables organizations to provide external services while maintaining strict control over what traffic can flow between network zones, supporting the principle of least privilege at the network layer."
  how: "A DMZ is implemented using firewalls that enforce zone-based security policies. In a dual-firewall configuration, the outer firewall allows inbound traffic from the internet to specific DMZ services on designated ports, while the inner firewall controls traffic from the DMZ to the internal network with strict rules allowing only necessary communication. Network address translation, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and logging are typically deployed at the DMZ boundaries. DMZ servers are hardened with minimal services, and management access to DMZ systems is provided through separate management networks or jump hosts. Security monitoring focuses heavily on DMZ traffic for indicators of compromise."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Dual-Firewall Architecture"
      value: "DMZ design using separate outer and inner firewalls from different vendors to provide defense in depth and reduce the risk of a single vulnerability compromising both boundaries"
    - key: "Zone-Based Policy"
      value: "Firewall rules that define permitted traffic flows between external, DMZ, and internal zones based on source zone, destination zone, protocol, and port"
    - key: "Service Isolation"
      value: "The principle of hosting only public-facing services in the DMZ with minimal connectivity to internal resources, limiting lateral movement after compromise"
