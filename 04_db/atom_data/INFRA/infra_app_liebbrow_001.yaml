definition:
  what: >-
    Liebao Browser (Cheetah Browser) is a Chromium-based web browser developed by Cheetah
    Mobile (formerly Kingsoft) primarily targeting the Chinese market. Available for Windows
    and Android, it features dual rendering engines (Chromium Blink and IE Trident for
    compatibility), built-in ad blocking, and integration with Chinese internet services.
    The browser stores credentials, cookies, and browsing data in the standard Chromium
    profile format.
  why: >-
    Liebao Browser is targeted by infostealer malware for credential harvesting alongside
    other Chromium-based browsers. Major infostealers including RedLine, Raccoon, and Vidar
    include Liebao in their target lists. The browser's dual-engine design (Chromium + Trident)
    expands the attack surface. Cheetah Mobile has faced privacy controversies over data
    collection practices and ad fraud. As a Chinese-market browser, it may have different
    security update cadences and privacy policies than mainstream browsers.
  how: >-
    Liebao Browser uses Chromium for modern web rendering and falls back to Trident (IE engine)
    for legacy website compatibility. User data is stored in the standard Chromium SQLite
    database format with DPAPI encryption on Windows. Infostealer malware targets Liebao's
    profile directories at known filesystem paths to extract credentials, cookies, and autofill
    data. The dual-engine architecture means vulnerabilities in both Chromium and Trident
    engines are potentially exploitable. The browser communicates with Cheetah Mobile servers
    for update checks and integrated services.

    the Chinese market with dual rendering engines (Chromium Blink and IE Trident). It stores
    credentials in standard Chromium SQLite format with DPAPI encryption. Liebao is targeted
    by infostealer families including RedLine, Raccoon, and Vidar for credential harvesting.
    The dual-engine design expands the attack surface across both modern and legacy rendering
    engines. Cheetah Mobile has faced privacy controversies over data collection practices.
    Security teams should restrict browser installations to approved options, monitor for
    unauthorized Chromium-based browsers, and implement controls against infostealer malware
    targeting browser profile directories.
