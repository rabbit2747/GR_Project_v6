definition:
  what: >-
    YouTube is a Google-owned video sharing and streaming platform with over 2.5 billion
    monthly active users, serving as the world's largest video hosting service and second-largest
    search engine. The platform supports video upload, live streaming, community interaction,
    monetization (YouTube Partner Program), and an extensive API ecosystem. YouTube provides
    web access, mobile applications (iOS, Android), smart TV apps, and embedded player
    capabilities. YouTube Studio enables content management, analytics, and channel
    administration.
  why: >-
    YouTube is exploited as a social engineering and malware distribution vector through
    video descriptions containing malicious links, fake software download tutorials leading
    to malware, and compromised channel accounts used for cryptocurrency scams and live stream
    fraud. YouTube comments and community posts distribute phishing links. The platform's
    advertising system has been abused for malvertising campaigns. YouTube API keys and OAuth
    tokens, if leaked, enable channel takeover and content manipulation. Creator accounts
    are high-value targets for credential theft through phishing, with stolen channels used
    for large-scale scam operations. YouTube's data collection and tracking capabilities
    raise privacy concerns in enterprise environments.
  how: >-
    YouTube operates on Google Cloud infrastructure with a web application and REST/gRPC
    APIs. Video content is transcoded into multiple formats and resolutions, served through
    Google's global CDN. Authentication uses Google accounts with OAuth 2.0 for API access.
    The YouTube Data API v3 provides programmatic access to video management, playlist
    operations, and channel configuration. YouTube uses adaptive bitrate streaming (DASH/HLS)
    for video delivery. Content moderation uses automated systems (machine learning) and
    manual review. The YouTube iframe embed API enables video playback integration in
    third-party websites. Monetization integrates with Google AdSense for advertising revenue.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Social Engineering Distribution Platform"
      value: "YouTube videos and descriptions are used to distribute malware through fake software tutorials, cryptocurrency scams, and malicious links reaching billions of users"
    - key: "Channel Account Compromise"
      value: "Creator accounts are targeted through phishing for channel takeover, enabling large-scale scam operations leveraging the channel's established audience and trust"
    - key: "Enterprise Privacy and Productivity"
      value: "YouTube's tracking capabilities, data collection, and bandwidth consumption create privacy and productivity concerns requiring enterprise policy controls"

  embedding_text: >-
    YouTube is a Google-owned video platform with 2.5+ billion monthly users, the world's
    largest video hosting service. It is exploited for social engineering through malicious
    video descriptions, fake software tutorials distributing malware, and compromised channels
    running cryptocurrency scams. Comments and community posts distribute phishing links.
    The advertising system has been abused for malvertising. Leaked API keys and OAuth tokens
    enable channel takeover. Creator accounts are high-value phishing targets with stolen
    channels used for scam operations. Security teams should implement web filtering policies
    for YouTube access, monitor for leaked API credentials, train users on YouTube-based
    social engineering, restrict YouTube API access to authorized applications, and implement
    enterprise controls for data privacy and bandwidth management.
