definition:
  what: >-
    Web Server Application is a general category encompassing software platforms that host,
    execute, and serve web applications over HTTP/HTTPS. This includes traditional application
    servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Nginx+app modules), Java EE containers (WebLogic, WebSphere,
    WildFly), and modern framework-embedded servers (Spring Boot, Node.js). These platforms
    provide the runtime environment, request routing, session management, and middleware
    services required by web applications.
  why: >-
    Web server applications are the primary target for initial access attacks as they are
    public-facing by design. Common vulnerability classes include remote code execution through
    deserialization, SQL injection, path traversal, server-side request forgery (SSRF),
    authentication bypass, and misconfiguration. Exposed administration interfaces, default
    credentials, and unpatched servers are continuously targeted by automated scanning.
    Successful exploitation provides a foothold for lateral movement into internal networks.
    Web server misconfigurations including verbose error pages, directory listing, and debug
    endpoints leak sensitive information.
  how: >-
    Web server applications listen on HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports, processing incoming
    requests through a pipeline of handlers, filters, and application code. They manage
    session state, authenticate users, route requests to application logic, and return
    responses. Application servers provide additional services including connection pooling,
    transaction management, and messaging. Configuration files control virtual hosts, SSL/TLS
    settings, access controls, and logging. Reverse proxies often front application servers
    for load balancing, SSL termination, and additional security filtering.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Public-Facing Attack Surface"
      value: "Web servers are exposed to the internet by design, making them the primary vector for initial access through application-layer vulnerabilities"
    - key: "Configuration Security"
      value: "Misconfigurations including default credentials, verbose errors, directory listing, and debug endpoints are common and provide significant intelligence to attackers"
    - key: "Application Runtime Environment"
      value: "Provides the execution context for application code, and vulnerabilities in the server itself affect all hosted applications simultaneously"

  embedding_text: >-
    Web Server Application is the general category of platforms hosting and serving web
    applications over HTTP/HTTPS, including traditional servers (Tomcat, Nginx), Java EE
    containers (WebLogic, WebSphere, WildFly), and modern embedded servers (Spring Boot,
    Node.js). As public-facing infrastructure, these are primary targets for initial access
    through RCE, deserialization, SQLi, SSRF, and authentication bypass. Common issues
    include default credentials, verbose errors, directory listing, and exposed admin
    interfaces. Security teams should harden configurations, patch regularly, implement WAF
    protection, restrict administration access, remove default content, configure secure
    TLS settings, and monitor for exploitation attempts against hosted applications.
