definition:
  what: >-
    GlobalProtect is Palo Alto Networks' VPN and remote access solution providing secure
    connectivity to enterprise networks. It consists of a gateway (integrated into PAN-OS
    firewalls), a portal for configuration distribution, and endpoint agents for Windows, macOS,
    Linux, iOS, and Android. GlobalProtect extends next-generation firewall security policies
    to remote users regardless of location.
  why: >-
    GlobalProtect is a primary remote access mechanism for enterprises using Palo Alto Networks
    infrastructure. It has been targeted by threat actors exploiting PAN-OS vulnerabilities
    including CVE-2024-3400 (command injection in GlobalProtect gateway), CVE-2021-3064
    (buffer overflow in GlobalProtect portal), and CVE-2020-2034 (OS command injection).
    Compromising GlobalProtect provides direct authenticated access to internal networks.
  how: >-
    GlobalProtect establishes IPsec or SSL VPN tunnels between endpoint agents and PAN-OS
    gateways. The portal distributes gateway configurations and agent settings. Host Information
    Profile (HIP) checks enforce endpoint compliance before granting access, verifying
    antivirus status, disk encryption, OS patches, and domain membership. Split tunneling
    policies route traffic through the tunnel or directly to the internet. Integration with
    Prisma Access extends GlobalProtect to cloud-delivered SASE architecture.

  embedding_text: >-
    GlobalProtect is Palo Alto Networks' VPN solution providing secure remote access via IPsec
    and SSL tunnels to PAN-OS gateways. Endpoint agents for all major platforms enforce
    security policies on remote users. Host Information Profile checks verify endpoint
    compliance. Integrates with Prisma Access for SASE. Has been targeted via critical PAN-OS
    vulnerabilities including CVE-2024-3400 command injection and CVE-2021-3064 buffer overflow.
    Compromising GlobalProtect provides direct internal network access to threat actors.
