definition:
  what: >-
    EcoStruxure is Schneider Electric's IoT-enabled, open, interoperable architecture and platform
    for industrial automation, building management, power distribution, and data center
    infrastructure. The platform spans three layers: connected products (sensors, actuators,
    PLCs, drives), edge control (SCADA, BMS, DCS), and apps/analytics/services (cloud-based
    monitoring, predictive maintenance). Key components include EcoStruxure Control Expert
    (formerly Unity Pro) for PLC programming, EcoStruxure Machine Expert for machine automation,
    and EcoStruxure Building Operation for building management systems.
  why: >-
    EcoStruxure manages critical infrastructure across industrial, building, and power
    distribution domains, making it a high-value target for ICS attacks. Vulnerabilities in
    EcoStruxure components have been documented in multiple CISA/ICS-CERT advisories including
    authentication bypass, hardcoded credentials, and remote code execution in Control Expert
    (CVE-2020-7488, CVE-2020-7489). The TRITON/TRISIS malware campaign targeted Schneider
    Electric Triconex safety systems. Compromise of EcoStruxure can affect physical safety
    systems, building access controls, power distribution, and industrial processes.
  how: >-
    EcoStruxure operates through a layered architecture. At the product layer, Modicon PLCs,
    Altivar drives, and PowerLogic meters communicate via Modbus TCP/IP, EtherNet/IP, and
    OPC UA. The edge control layer runs SCADA servers, HMI panels, and DCS controllers that
    aggregate data and execute control logic. The cloud layer provides analytics dashboards,
    predictive maintenance algorithms, and remote monitoring. Programming and configuration
    use proprietary tools (Control Expert, Machine Expert) communicating with controllers
    over industrial protocols. Security features include role-based access control, encrypted
    communications, and cybersecurity modules integrated into newer product lines.
