definition:
  what: >-
    ScSecSvc (Security Center Service, wscsvc) is a Windows operating system service that
    monitors the security health state of the system. It tracks the status of antivirus,
    firewall, automatic updates, Internet security settings, User Account Control, and
    Windows Defender. The service reports security provider registration status to the
    Windows Security Center (Action Center in Windows 10/11) and provides WMI interfaces
    for third-party security products to register their status.
  why: >-
    The Security Center Service provides centralized visibility into endpoint security posture
    on Windows systems. It detects when antivirus is disabled, firewall is turned off, or
    updates are not current. Attackers frequently target this service to suppress security
    alerts after disabling protection tools. Malware may modify Security Center registry
    keys or stop the service to prevent users and administrators from receiving alerts about
    disabled security controls.
  how: >-
    The service monitors Windows Security Providers via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)
    namespace root\SecurityCenter2. Security products register as antivirus, antispyware, or
    firewall providers through the Windows Security Center API. The service polls provider
    status and generates Windows notifications when security state degrades. Registry keys
    under HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center control service behavior. Group Policy
    can configure notification suppression. The service interacts with Windows Defender,
    third-party AV products, and Windows Firewall state.
