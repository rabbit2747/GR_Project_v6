definition:
  what: >-
    PagerDuty is a cloud-based incident management and digital operations platform that provides
    real-time alerting, on-call scheduling, escalation policies, and incident response
    orchestration. It integrates with monitoring tools (Datadog, Nagios, Splunk, CloudWatch),
    ITSM platforms (ServiceNow, Jira), and communication tools (Slack, Teams) through extensive
    API integrations and webhooks. PagerDuty processes alerts from infrastructure monitoring
    systems and routes them to on-call responders based on configurable escalation policies.
  why: >-
    PagerDuty is security-relevant as a critical operations infrastructure component with deep
    integration into monitoring and incident response workflows. Compromise of PagerDuty accounts
    enables attackers to suppress security alerts, manipulate escalation policies to prevent
    incident detection, and access sensitive infrastructure information exposed through
    integrations. PagerDuty API keys and integration tokens are frequently found in code
    repositories, configuration files, and CI/CD pipelines. Attackers who compromise PagerDuty
    can blind security operations during active attacks by suppressing or acknowledging alerts.
    The platform's webhooks and API integrations can be abused for data exfiltration or
    command-and-control communication.
  how: >-
    PagerDuty operates as a SaaS platform accessed through web interface and REST API. Monitoring
    tools send alerts via API integrations using service-specific integration keys. Webhooks
    deliver event notifications to configured endpoints. The Events API v2 accepts structured
    alert payloads. Attackers exploit leaked API keys to manipulate incidents (acknowledge,
    resolve, suppress alerts), modify escalation policies, or extract infrastructure information
    from alert payloads. Compromised integration webhooks can serve as data exfiltration channels.
    Account takeover through credential stuffing or phishing of PagerDuty accounts enables
    manipulation of incident response workflows during active attacks.

  embedding_text: >-
    PagerDuty is a cloud-based incident management platform providing real-time alerting, on-call
    scheduling, and escalation policies with deep integrations into monitoring tools, ITSM
    platforms, and communication systems. Security concerns include alert suppression by
    attackers who compromise PagerDuty accounts to blind security operations during active
    attacks, API key and integration token leakage in code repositories and CI/CD pipelines,
    and webhook abuse for data exfiltration. Compromised accounts enable manipulation of
    escalation policies and incident acknowledgment to prevent detection. PagerDuty's extensive
    API integrations expose infrastructure information through alert payloads. Security teams
    should rotate API keys regularly, enforce MFA on PagerDuty accounts, monitor for unauthorized
    escalation policy changes, audit webhook configurations, and implement alerts on PagerDuty
    administrative actions to detect compromise of the incident management platform itself.
