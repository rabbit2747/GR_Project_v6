definition:
  what: "GCP Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management) is Google Cloud Platform's access control service that manages who (identity) can do what (roles) on which resources (resource hierarchy). It provides fine-grained access control through predefined and custom roles bound to members at the organization, folder, project, or resource level. IAM supports Google accounts, service accounts, Google Groups, and Workload Identity Federation for external identity providers."
  why: "Cloud IAM is the foundational security control for GCP environments because it governs all access to cloud resources. Misconfigured IAM policies are the leading cause of cloud security incidents, enabling privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, and lateral movement. Overly permissive service account keys are frequently exploited by attackers. IAM policy evaluation follows the resource hierarchy, making organization-level misconfigurations particularly dangerous. Proper least-privilege IAM configuration is required for all major compliance frameworks."
  how: "IAM policies bind members to roles at specific levels in the resource hierarchy (organization > folder > project > resource). Policies are inherited downward and evaluated at each level. Predefined roles provide curated permission sets for specific services. Custom roles enable precise permission combinations. Service accounts provide identity for applications and workloads. Workload Identity Federation enables external identities to access GCP without service account keys. IAM Conditions add attribute-based access control. Policy Analyzer and Recommender tools help identify overprivileged access."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Resource Hierarchy"
      value: "Organizational structure (organization > folder > project > resource) through which IAM policies are inherited and evaluated"
    - key: "Service Account"
      value: "Non-human identity used by applications and workloads to authenticate to GCP services, often a key target for credential theft"
    - key: "IAM Role Binding"
      value: "Association of a member (user, group, service account) with a role at a specific level in the resource hierarchy"
    - key: "Workload Identity Federation"
      value: "Mechanism enabling external identities from AWS, Azure, or OIDC providers to access GCP without long-lived service account keys"
