definition:
  what: >-
    CloudMe is a Swedish cloud storage and file synchronization service that provides online
    backup, file sharing, and collaboration features. It offers desktop synchronization clients
    for Windows, macOS, and Linux, mobile apps, and a web interface for accessing stored files.
    CloudMe is notable in cybersecurity due to known buffer overflow vulnerabilities in its
    desktop synchronization client (particularly the Windows client) which have been widely
    used in penetration testing training and exploit development exercises. The CloudMe Sync
    client has had multiple CVEs including stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
  why: >-
    CloudMe is security-relevant because its desktop client has been a frequent target for
    exploit development due to documented buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Cloud storage
    services like CloudMe also represent potential data exfiltration channels where adversaries
    can use legitimate cloud sync tools to stage and exfiltrate data from compromised networks.
    The service's file synchronization capability can be abused for both data collection and
    command-and-control purposes when installed on compromised endpoints.
  how: >-
    CloudMe operates through client-server architecture where desktop and mobile clients
    synchronize local file system directories with cloud-hosted storage. The sync client
    listens on a local TCP port (default 8888) for inter-process communication, which has
    been the attack vector for known buffer overflow exploits. File data is transferred over
    HTTPS to CloudMe's cloud infrastructure hosted in Sweden. Access control is managed
    through account-based authentication with optional sharing links for collaboration.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Buffer Overflow Vulnerability History"
      value: >-
        The CloudMe Sync Windows client has had multiple stack-based buffer overflow
        vulnerabilities in its local TCP listener, making it a common target in exploit
        development and penetration testing training materials.
    - key: "Cloud Storage Exfiltration Vector"
      value: >-
        Cloud synchronization services like CloudMe can be abused by adversaries as data
        staging and exfiltration channels, leveraging legitimate cloud traffic to evade
        network-based detection.

    CloudMe is a Swedish cloud storage and file synchronization service providing online backup,
    file sharing, and collaboration features through desktop clients, mobile apps, and a web
    interface. CloudMe is particularly notable in cybersecurity due to documented buffer overflow
    vulnerabilities in its Windows desktop synchronization client, which listens on local TCP
    port 8888. These stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities have made CloudMe a common
    target in exploit development training and penetration testing exercises. Beyond its
    vulnerability history, CloudMe represents a cloud storage exfiltration vector where
    adversaries can abuse legitimate synchronization tools for data staging and exfiltration
    (MITRE ATT&CK T1567.002). Cloud storage services like CloudMe can blend malicious data
    transfers with legitimate cloud traffic, complicating network-based detection efforts.
