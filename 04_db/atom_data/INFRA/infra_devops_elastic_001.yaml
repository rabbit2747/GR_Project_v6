definition:
  what: "Elastic (Elastic Stack/ELK) is a search, observability, and security analytics platform built on Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash. Elasticsearch provides distributed search and analytics engine capabilities. Kibana offers visualization and management. Beats are lightweight data shippers. Logstash is a data processing pipeline. Elastic Security provides SIEM, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and threat intelligence integration for security operations centers."
  why: "Elastic is critical for security operations as it serves as the data backbone for SIEM, log aggregation, threat hunting, and incident investigation in many organizations. Exposed or misconfigured Elasticsearch instances have caused numerous data breaches by leaking indexed sensitive data. Attackers target Elasticsearch for data theft, index manipulation to hide evidence, and exploitation of unsecured instances. Elastic Security's detection rules and machine learning capabilities are essential for threat detection in modern SOCs."
  how: "Elastic operates through Elasticsearch clusters that index and store JSON documents in distributed shards across nodes. Beats agents and Logstash pipelines collect and transform log data from sources across the infrastructure. Kibana provides dashboards, search interfaces, and Elastic Security's SIEM workspace. Detection rules match patterns in indexed data to identify threats. Machine learning jobs detect anomalies in time-series data. Index lifecycle management automates data retention. Role-based access control and encryption protect data in transit and at rest."
