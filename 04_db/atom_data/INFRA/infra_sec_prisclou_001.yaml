definition:
  what: >-
    Prisma Cloud is Palo Alto Networks' Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)
    providing security across the full cloud-native lifecycle. Built from acquisitions of
    RedLock (CSPM), Twistlock (container security), PureSec (serverless), and Bridgecrew
    (IaC scanning). Covers Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), Cloud Workload Protection
    (CWP), Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM), Cloud Network Security, and
    Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI.
  why: >-
    Cloud environments have unique security challenges including misconfiguration, identity
    sprawl, container vulnerabilities, and serverless risks that traditional tools cannot
    address. Prisma Cloud provides unified visibility across multi-cloud deployments. Cloud
    misconfigurations are the leading cause of cloud data breaches, and runtime protection
    is essential for detecting container escapes, cryptomining, and lateral movement in
    cloud-native architectures.
  how: >-
    Prisma Cloud connects to cloud provider APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP) for CSPM assessment,
    scanning configurations against CIS Benchmarks and compliance frameworks. Agents (Defenders)
    deploy into container runtimes, Kubernetes clusters, and serverless functions for workload
    protection. IaC scanning integrates with CI/CD pipelines via Bridgecrew/Checkov. CIEM
    analyzes cloud IAM permissions for excess privilege. Network Security monitors cloud
    network flows. Unified dashboard provides risk prioritization across all cloud assets.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "CNAPP Consolidation"
      value: "Unified platform combining CSPM, CWP, CIEM, network security, and IaC scanning for comprehensive cloud-native protection"
    - key: "Shift-Left Security"
      value: "IaC scanning via Bridgecrew/Checkov catches misconfigurations in Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes manifests before deployment"
    - key: "Runtime Protection"
      value: "Container and serverless runtime defenders detect anomalous behavior, container escapes, and cryptomining in production"
