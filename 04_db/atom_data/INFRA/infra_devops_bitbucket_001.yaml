definition:
  what: "Bitbucket is an Atlassian-hosted Git repository management platform that provides source code hosting, pull request workflows, built-in CI/CD through Bitbucket Pipelines, and integration with the Atlassian ecosystem including Jira and Confluence. It supports both cloud-hosted and self-managed (Data Center) deployment models with branch permissions, merge checks, and code review capabilities."
  why: "Bitbucket is security-relevant as a source code management platform that stores proprietary code, secrets embedded in commit history, and CI/CD pipeline configurations. Compromised Bitbucket accounts enable source code theft, malicious code injection into build pipelines, and supply chain attacks through modified repository content. Pipeline secrets and deployment credentials stored in Bitbucket represent high-value targets for attackers. Repository access controls and branch protection rules are critical for preventing unauthorized code changes."
  how: "Bitbucket provides Git-based version control with branch permissions controlling who can push to protected branches. Bitbucket Pipelines executes CI/CD workflows defined in bitbucket-pipelines.yml files within repositories. Two-factor authentication and IP whitelisting protect account access. Merge checks enforce code review requirements and successful pipeline execution before merging. Integration with Jira enables traceability between code changes and issue tracking. Bitbucket Apps extend functionality through marketplace integrations."
