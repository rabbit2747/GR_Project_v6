# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Check Point SandBlast is an advanced threat prevention suite combining sandboxing (Threat
    Emulation), content disarm and reconstruction (Threat Extraction), anti-ransomware, anti-bot,
    and zero-day protection. Available as network appliance (SandBlast Network), endpoint agent
    (SandBlast Agent/Harmony Endpoint), cloud service (SandBlast Cloud), and email security
    gateway (SandBlast for Office 365/Google Workspace). Part of the Check Point Infinity
    architecture.
  why: >-
    Traditional signature-based detection cannot identify zero-day malware and advanced persistent
    threats. SandBlast addresses this by detonating suspicious files in sandbox environments
    and delivering sanitized content via Threat Extraction. Check Point gateways have also
    been targeted: CVE-2024-24919 (information disclosure in Security Gateways) was actively
    exploited to extract VPN credentials and enable network intrusion. SandBlast provides
    defense-in-depth against evasive malware that bypasses perimeter controls.
  how: >-
    Threat Emulation detonates suspicious files in CPU-level sandboxes that detect evasion
    techniques by monitoring at the CPU instruction level rather than OS API level. Threat
    Extraction strips active content (macros, JavaScript, embedded objects) from documents
    and delivers sanitized versions immediately while sandbox analysis continues. SandBlast
    Agent provides endpoint-level protection with anti-ransomware behavioral detection,
    forensic analysis, and automated incident response. ThreatCloud intelligence feeds
    provide real-time threat indicators across all deployment modes.
