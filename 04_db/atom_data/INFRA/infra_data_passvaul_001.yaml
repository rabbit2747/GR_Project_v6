definition:
  what: >-
    A Password Vault is a hardened, centralized secure storage system specifically designed to
    protect privileged credentials, secrets, certificates, and encryption keys. Distinguished
    from general password stores, password vaults are enterprise-grade security controls that
    enforce strict access policies, provide comprehensive audit trails, and implement credential
    lifecycle management. Key implementations include CyberArk Enterprise Password Vault,
    HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager, and Thycotic
    (Delinea) Secret Server. Password vaults are core components of Privileged Access Management
    (PAM) architectures.
  why: >-
    Password vaults are critical security infrastructure that protect the most sensitive
    credentials in an organization: administrative passwords, service account credentials,
    database connection strings, API keys, and encryption keys. They prevent credential sprawl
    where privileged passwords are stored in plaintext files, scripts, and shared documents.
    Compromise of a password vault is a catastrophic security event enabling full organizational
    compromise. Adversaries specifically target vault infrastructure as the ultimate credential
    access objective, making vault hardening and monitoring essential.
  how: >-
    Password vaults store secrets in encrypted form using FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic
    modules. Access requires multi-factor authentication and is governed by granular policies
    defining who can access which credentials under what conditions. Credential checkout and
    check-in workflows manage access to shared privileged accounts. Automatic password rotation
    changes credentials on target systems on schedule or after each use. Session recording
    captures privileged user activities for audit and forensic purposes. Just-in-time (JIT)
    access grants temporary credentials that expire automatically. API-based secret injection
    provides credentials to applications without embedding them in code or configuration files.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Privileged Access Management"
      value: >-
        Password vaults are the core storage component of PAM architectures, controlling access
        to privileged credentials through policy-based checkout, approval workflows, and
        comprehensive audit trails.
    - key: "Automatic Credential Rotation"
      value: >-
        Vaults automatically change passwords on target systems on schedule or after each use,
        limiting the window of exposure for compromised credentials and eliminating static
        passwords.
    - key: "Secret Injection"
      value: >-
        Applications retrieve credentials from vaults at runtime through APIs rather than
        embedding them in code or configuration, eliminating hardcoded secrets and enabling
        centralized credential management.
    - key: "Multi-Factor Vault Access"
      value: >-
        Access to vault contents requires multi-factor authentication, ensuring that compromise
        of a single authentication factor cannot expose stored secrets.
