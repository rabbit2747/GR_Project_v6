definition:
  what: >-
    GCP Assured Workloads is a compliance and sovereignty service that enables organizations to
    create controlled environments within Google Cloud that enforce regulatory requirements such
    as FedRAMP High, IL4/IL5, CJIS, ITAR, and regional data residency. Assured Workloads
    automatically restricts resource locations, enforces encryption with customer-managed keys,
    limits Google personnel access based on citizenship requirements, and applies organization
    policy constraints to ensure continuous compliance.
  why: >-
    Assured Workloads addresses the critical challenge of running regulated workloads in public
    cloud environments. Misconfiguration of compliance boundaries can result in data sovereignty
    violations, regulatory penalties, and loss of government certifications. Attackers targeting
    regulated environments may attempt to move data outside compliance boundaries or compromise
    the encryption key management chain. Continuous compliance monitoring prevents drift.
  how: >-
    Assured Workloads creates compliance-enforced folders within GCP organizations with
    automatically applied Organization Policy constraints. Resources within these folders are
    restricted to approved regions and services. Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) with
    Cloud KMS or Cloud External Key Manager enforce data protection. Key Access Justifications
    provide visibility into Google access to encryption keys. Access Transparency logs all
    Google administrative access. Monitoring detects compliance violations in real-time.

    GCP Assured Workloads is a compliance and sovereignty service creating controlled
    environments enforcing regulatory requirements like FedRAMP High, IL4/IL5, CJIS, and ITAR.
    It automatically restricts resource locations, enforces CMEK encryption, limits Google
    personnel access based on citizenship, and applies Organization Policy constraints.
    Misconfiguration can cause data sovereignty violations and regulatory penalties. Key Access
    Justifications provide visibility into Google access to encryption keys. Continuous
    compliance monitoring prevents configuration drift in regulated environments.
