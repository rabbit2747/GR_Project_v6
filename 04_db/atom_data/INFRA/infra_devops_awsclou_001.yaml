definition:
  what: "AWS CloudWatch is Amazon Web Services' native monitoring and observability service that collects, aggregates, and analyzes metrics, logs, and event data from AWS resources, applications, and on-premises servers. It provides dashboards, alarms, anomaly detection, and automated actions to maintain operational health across cloud infrastructure. CloudWatch covers compute, storage, database, networking, and application layers with unified metric collection and log aggregation."
  why: "CloudWatch is critical for security operations because it provides centralized visibility into AWS resource behavior, enables detection of anomalous activity patterns, supports compliance audit trails through log retention, and triggers automated incident response through CloudWatch Alarms and EventBridge integration. Adversaries frequently target CloudWatch configurations to disable monitoring or tamper with log data to evade detection."
  how: "CloudWatch operates through agents installed on EC2 instances and Lambda functions, native integrations with AWS services, and API-based metric publication. It ingests metrics at configurable intervals (1-second to 5-minute granularity), stores logs in Log Groups with configurable retention, applies Metric Filters and Insights queries for analysis, and triggers CloudWatch Alarms that invoke SNS notifications, Auto Scaling actions, or Lambda functions. CloudWatch Logs Insights enables interactive log analysis using a purpose-built query language."
