definition:
  what: >-
    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is Oracle's cloud computing platform providing compute
    (Bare Metal, VM, Container Instances), networking (VCN, Load Balancer, FastConnect),
    storage (Block Volumes, Object Storage, File Storage), database (Autonomous Database,
    MySQL, Exadata Cloud), and security services (Cloud Guard, Vault, IAM). The OCI SDK and
    CLI libraries provide programmatic access to all OCI services via REST APIs with
    request signing using RSA key pairs for authentication.
  why: >-
    OCI is targeted for its enterprise database workloads and Oracle application hosting.
    Security concerns include IAM policy misconfiguration using Oracle's unique policy language,
    API key exposure (PEM private keys), instance principal abuse, cross-tenancy attacks,
    insecure Object Storage bucket policies, and VCN security list misconfigurations. The OCI
    SDK and CLI store authentication credentials (API keys, config files) that become credential
    theft targets on developer workstations and CI/CD pipelines.
  how: >-
    OCI uses a compartment-based resource hierarchy with IAM policies written in a human-
    readable policy language (Allow group X to manage Y in compartment Z). Authentication
    uses API key signing (RSA key pairs), instance principals for VM authentication, or
    resource principals for service-to-service access. Cloud Guard provides automated threat
    detection and response. OCI Vault manages encryption keys with HSM backing. Security
    Zones enforce security posture on compartments. VCN security lists and network security
    groups control network access.

    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides compute, networking, storage, database, and
    security services with SDK/CLI libraries for programmatic access. Uses compartment-based
    resource hierarchy with a unique IAM policy language. Authentication via RSA API key
    signing, instance principals, or resource principals. Security concerns include IAM policy
    misconfiguration, API key exposure, instance principal abuse, and Object Storage
    misconfigurations. Cloud Guard provides automated threat detection. OCI Vault manages
    encryption keys. Security Zones enforce security posture on compartments.
