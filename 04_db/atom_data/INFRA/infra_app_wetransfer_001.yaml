definition:
  what: >-
    WeTransfer is a cloud-based file transfer service that allows users to send large files
    (up to 2GB free, 200GB paid) via temporary download links. The platform provides a simple
    web-based interface requiring no account for basic transfers, with Pro and Premium tiers
    offering password protection, custom branding, and extended storage. WeTransfer is widely
    used in creative industries for sharing design files, media assets, and large documents
    between organizations and individuals.
  why: >-
    WeTransfer is frequently abused as a data exfiltration channel because it allows large
    file uploads without authentication, uses HTTPS to bypass content inspection, and generates
    legitimate-looking download links that blend with normal business traffic. Attackers use
    WeTransfer to exfiltrate stolen data, distribute malware payloads through shared links,
    and conduct phishing campaigns impersonating WeTransfer notification emails. The temporary
    nature of transfers (files expire after 7 days) complicates forensic investigation.
    Legitimate WeTransfer domains and IP ranges are typically whitelisted by security controls,
    making it an attractive channel for data theft.
  how: >-
    WeTransfer operates through a web application with REST API backend. Files are uploaded
    via HTTPS to WeTransfer's cloud infrastructure (AWS-based), encrypted at rest, and made
    available through unique download URLs. Email notifications are sent to recipients with
    download links. The free tier requires no authentication, while Pro accounts offer
    password protection and transfer tracking. Files are automatically deleted after the
    expiration period. WeTransfer also provides an API for programmatic file transfers and
    integration with third-party applications.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Legitimate Exfiltration Channel"
      value: "WeTransfer's HTTPS-based file transfer with no-auth uploads and whitelisted domains makes it an ideal channel for data exfiltration that blends with normal business traffic"
    - key: "Phishing Impersonation Vector"
      value: "WeTransfer notification emails are commonly spoofed in phishing campaigns to distribute malware or harvest credentials through fake download pages"
    - key: "Forensic Challenges"
      value: "Temporary file storage with automatic deletion after 7 days and minimal logging for free accounts complicates incident response and forensic investigation"

  embedding_text: >-
    WeTransfer is a cloud-based file transfer service allowing large file sharing via temporary
    download links without requiring authentication for basic use. It is frequently abused as
    a data exfiltration channel because HTTPS uploads bypass content inspection and legitimate
    WeTransfer domains are typically whitelisted. Attackers use it to exfiltrate stolen data,
    distribute malware through shared links, and conduct phishing via spoofed notification
    emails. The temporary nature of transfers complicates forensic investigation. Security
    teams should monitor for unusual WeTransfer upload volumes, implement DLP controls for
    cloud file sharing services, block or restrict WeTransfer access where not business-required,
    and train users to recognize WeTransfer phishing impersonation campaigns.
