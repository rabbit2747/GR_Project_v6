definition:
  what: >-
    ProtonMail (Proton Mail) is an end-to-end encrypted email service developed by Proton AG,
    headquartered in Switzerland. It uses client-side encryption with PGP to ensure that emails
    are encrypted before leaving the user's device. ProtonMail operates under Swiss privacy laws
    and claims zero-access architecture where the provider cannot read user emails. The service
    supports web, mobile, and desktop clients, and provides bridge software for integration
    with standard email clients via IMAP/SMTP.
  why: >-
    ProtonMail is relevant to cybersecurity as a privacy-focused email service frequently used
    by both legitimate privacy-conscious users and threat actors. APT groups, ransomware
    operators, and cybercriminals use ProtonMail for anonymous communication, ransom negotiation
    contact addresses, and command-and-control communication due to its end-to-end encryption
    and Swiss jurisdiction. ProtonMail addresses appear frequently in ransomware payment
    instructions and initial access broker communications. The service's encryption makes
    interception and monitoring of threat actor communications difficult for law enforcement and
    incident response teams. ProtonMail accounts are also targeted by state-sponsored actors
    for credential theft against activists and journalists.
  how: >-
    ProtonMail implements end-to-end encryption using OpenPGP with client-side key generation
    and management. Emails between ProtonMail users are encrypted automatically. Emails to
    external recipients can be protected with password-based encryption. The ProtonMail Bridge
    provides IMAP/SMTP access for desktop email clients with local decryption. Threat actors
    create anonymous ProtonMail accounts for ransomware contact addresses, phishing campaign
    infrastructure, and covert communication channels. Law enforcement access requires Swiss
    legal process, complicating international investigations. ProtonMail has cooperated with
    authorities in specific cases, providing IP logging when required by Swiss court orders,
    despite its privacy-focused marketing.

    ProtonMail (Proton Mail) is an end-to-end encrypted email service by Proton AG based in
    Switzerland, using client-side PGP encryption with zero-access architecture. ProtonMail is
    frequently used by threat actors including ransomware operators, APT groups, and cybercriminals
    for anonymous communication, ransom negotiation contacts, and covert C2 channels due to its
    encryption and Swiss privacy jurisdiction. ProtonMail addresses appear commonly in ransomware
    payment instructions. The service's encryption complicates law enforcement interception and
    incident response investigation, though ProtonMail has cooperated with Swiss court orders for
    IP logging. ProtonMail accounts are also targeted by state-sponsored actors against activists
    and journalists. Security teams should monitor for ProtonMail addresses in threat intelligence,
    track ProtonMail usage in organizational communications, and include ProtonMail indicators in
    ransomware response playbooks.
