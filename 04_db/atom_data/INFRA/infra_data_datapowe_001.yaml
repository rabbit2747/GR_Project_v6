definition:
  what: >-
    IBM DataPower Gateway is a purpose-built hardware or virtual appliance that provides API
    gateway, integration middleware, and security enforcement functions. Originally introduced as
    a hardware XML/SOA appliance, DataPower has evolved into a multi-protocol gateway supporting
    REST APIs, SOAP web services, JSON, XML processing, and message queue integration. It
    provides TLS termination, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, threat protection,
    and protocol mediation at the network edge or within the DMZ. DataPower is deployed as
    physical appliances, virtual appliances, or containerized instances on platforms including
    IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.
  why: >-
    DataPower addresses the need for high-performance, security-hardened API and integration
    gateways at the enterprise edge. It enforces security policies before traffic reaches
    backend services, providing defense-in-depth for API and web service architectures. Its
    purpose-built nature offers higher throughput and stronger security isolation than
    software-only solutions. DataPower is security-relevant as both a protective control
    (WAF, authentication, encryption) and as a target (compromise bypasses all downstream
    security enforcement).
  how: >-
    DataPower processes incoming requests through a configurable processing pipeline. Incoming
    connections are TLS-terminated and authenticated using certificates, OAuth tokens, SAML
    assertions, or API keys. Request content is validated against schemas, scanned for injection
    attacks, and transformed between protocols. Routing rules direct processed requests to
    backend services. Rate limiting and throttling prevent abuse. Logging and analytics capture
    traffic patterns and security events. Configuration is managed through a web GUI, CLI, or
    REST management interface. High availability is achieved through active-active clustering.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "API Gateway Security"
      value: >-
        DataPower enforces API security policies including authentication, authorization, rate
        limiting, and threat protection at the network edge before traffic reaches backend services.
    - key: "Protocol Mediation"
      value: >-
        Translates between protocols (REST, SOAP, MQ, JMS) enabling integration of heterogeneous
        backend services while presenting a unified API interface to consumers.
    - key: "Purpose-Built Security Appliance"
      value: >-
        DataPower runs a hardened, non-general-purpose operating system designed specifically
        for security-sensitive gateway functions, reducing the attack surface compared to
        software-only gateways on general-purpose OS platforms.
