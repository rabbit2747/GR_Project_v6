definition:
  what: "RubyGems is the package manager and hosting service for the Ruby programming language, providing a centralized repository (rubygems.org) for distributing Ruby libraries (gems). It manages gem versioning, dependency resolution, and installation through the gem CLI and Bundler dependency manager. RubyGems hosts over 170,000 gems used in Ruby on Rails applications, DevOps tools (Chef, Puppet, Vagrant), and security tools (Metasploit)."
  why: "RubyGems is a significant supply chain attack vector because Ruby is widely used in web applications (Rails), infrastructure automation (Chef, Puppet), and security tools. Malicious gems can execute arbitrary code during installation through extension building and post-install hooks. RubyGems has experienced supply chain attacks including typosquatting, account takeovers, and gem hijacking. The widespread use of Ruby in DevOps and infrastructure tools means compromised gems can affect entire deployment pipelines and production environments."
  how: "Developers declare gem dependencies in Gemfiles processed by Bundler. gem install downloads and installs gems from rubygems.org. Gems can execute native extension compilation during installation, providing code execution opportunities. RubyGems.org enforces MFA for privileged operations. Gem signing uses X.509 certificates but adoption is limited. Bundler lockfiles (Gemfile.lock) pin exact versions for reproducible installs. Private gem servers (Gemfury, Artifactory) host internal gems. gem push publishes new versions using API keys."

    - key: "Native Extensions"
      value: "C/C++ code compiled during gem installation that provides a code execution vector during the dependency installation process"
