definition:
  what: >-
    Remote Service is a general category encompassing Windows services and daemons that
    enable remote administration, command execution, and management across networked systems.
    This includes Windows Remote Management (WinRM), Remote Procedure Call (RPC), SSH services,
    remote registry, and other remote administration interfaces. These services allow
    administrators to manage systems without physical access, execute commands remotely,
    transfer files, and query system state across the network.
  why: >-
    Remote services are among the most commonly exploited attack vectors for lateral movement
    and remote code execution. Attackers abuse legitimate remote management protocols like
    WinRM, PsExec (via SMB/RPC), and SSH to move through compromised networks. Pass-the-Hash
    and Pass-the-Ticket attacks leverage remote service authentication. Exposed remote services
    on the internet are constantly scanned and targeted by automated attack tools. Misconfigured
    remote services with weak authentication or excessive permissions create entry points for
    initial access and privilege escalation.
  how: >-
    Remote services operate through various protocols and port combinations. WinRM uses HTTP/HTTPS
    (ports 5985/5986) with WS-Management protocol. RPC uses dynamic port allocation with endpoint
    mapper on port 135. SSH typically listens on port 22. These services authenticate through
    Windows integrated authentication (Kerberos/NTLM), certificate-based auth, or username/password
    combinations. Service configurations are managed through Group Policy, Windows Security
    Policy, and service-specific configuration tools. Network-level controls include firewall
    rules, network segmentation, and VPN requirements.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Lateral Movement Infrastructure"
      value: "Remote services provide the legitimate management channels that attackers abuse for lateral movement using stolen credentials or pass-the-hash techniques"
    - key: "Authentication Attack Surface"
      value: "Multiple authentication mechanisms (Kerberos, NTLM, certificates) create diverse attack vectors including relay attacks and credential theft"
    - key: "Service Exposure Risk"
      value: "Internet-facing remote services are continuously targeted by automated scanning and brute-force attacks against authentication"

  embedding_text: >-
    Remote Service encompasses Windows services enabling remote administration and command
    execution including WinRM, RPC, SSH, and remote registry. These services use various
    protocols and ports (WinRM 5985/5986, RPC 135, SSH 22) with multiple authentication
    mechanisms. Remote services are heavily targeted for lateral movement using stolen
    credentials, pass-the-hash, and pass-the-ticket attacks. Exposed services face
    continuous automated scanning and brute-force attempts. PsExec, WinRM, and SSH are
    commonly used by both administrators and attackers. Security considerations include
    authentication hardening, network segmentation, firewall restrictions, VPN requirements
    for access, and monitoring for anomalous remote service usage patterns indicating
    lateral movement or unauthorized access.
