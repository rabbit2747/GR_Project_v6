definition:
  what: >-
    QuickBooks is an accounting and financial management software developed by Intuit, widely
    used by small and medium businesses for bookkeeping, invoicing, payroll, tax preparation,
    and financial reporting. It is available as a desktop application (QuickBooks Desktop) and
    as a cloud-based SaaS platform (QuickBooks Online). The software manages sensitive financial
    data including bank account details, customer payment information, employee payroll records,
    and tax identification numbers.
  why: >-
    QuickBooks is a high-value target for attackers due to the concentration of sensitive
    financial data it manages. Compromised QuickBooks instances expose bank account numbers,
    credit card details, Social Security numbers, and complete financial histories. Phishing
    campaigns frequently impersonate Intuit and QuickBooks notifications to harvest credentials.
    The QuickBooks Database Server Manager exposes network ports that can be targeted for
    unauthorized access. Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks often target QuickBooks users
    to redirect invoice payments.
  how: >-
    QuickBooks Desktop stores data in company files (.QBW) using a proprietary database format,
    with multi-user access managed through QuickBooks Database Server Manager listening on TCP
    ports 8019-8023. QuickBooks Online operates as a cloud SaaS application accessed via web
    browser with OAuth-based authentication. Both versions integrate with banking APIs for
    transaction synchronization, payment processors for invoicing, and payroll services.
    Third-party app integrations expand functionality but also the attack surface through
    API access tokens.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Financial Data Concentration"
      value: "Centralizes banking, payroll, tax, and customer payment data making it a high-value target for data theft and financial fraud"
    - key: "Database Server Exposure"
      value: "QuickBooks Database Server Manager exposes TCP ports 8019-8023 for multi-user access, creating network-level attack surface"
    - key: "Invoice Fraud Vector"
      value: "BEC and phishing campaigns target QuickBooks users to redirect payments through modified invoices and fake payment notifications"

    QuickBooks is Intuit's accounting and financial management software used by millions of
    small and medium businesses. Available as desktop and cloud SaaS versions, it centralizes
    sensitive financial data including bank accounts, payroll records, tax IDs, and customer
    payment information. The QuickBooks Database Server Manager exposes TCP ports 8019-8023
    for multi-user access. QuickBooks is heavily targeted by phishing campaigns impersonating
    Intuit notifications, Business Email Compromise attacks redirecting invoice payments, and
    credential harvesting operations. Desktop versions store data in proprietary QBW files
    while the online version uses OAuth authentication and cloud APIs. Security concerns
    include financial data concentration, database server network exposure, third-party
    integration API tokens, and invoice fraud schemes targeting QuickBooks users.
