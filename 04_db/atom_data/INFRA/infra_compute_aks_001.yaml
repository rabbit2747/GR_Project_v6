definition:
  what: >-
    Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is Microsoft Azure's managed Kubernetes container orchestration
    platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    AKS handles critical tasks such as health monitoring, node provisioning, Kubernetes version
    upgrades, and control plane management, reducing the operational overhead of running Kubernetes
    clusters. It integrates natively with Azure Active Directory, Azure Monitor, Azure Policy,
    and Azure Container Registry for enterprise-grade security and governance.
  why: >-
    Organizations require managed Kubernetes platforms to reduce the complexity of self-hosting
    container orchestration infrastructure. AKS eliminates the need to manage the Kubernetes
    control plane, automates patching and upgrades, and provides built-in integration with
    Azure security services. This enables development teams to focus on application workloads
    rather than infrastructure management while maintaining enterprise compliance requirements.
  how: >-
    AKS provisions and manages the Kubernetes control plane as a fully managed Azure service,
    abstracting master node operations. Users define node pools with specified VM sizes and
    autoscaling policies. AKS integrates with Azure CNI or kubenet for networking, Azure Disk
    and Azure Files for persistent storage, and Azure AD for RBAC-based access control.
    Workloads are deployed via kubectl, Helm charts, or CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps
    or GitHub Actions.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Managed Control Plane"
      value: "Azure manages the Kubernetes API server, etcd, scheduler, and controller manager, eliminating control plane operational burden"
    - key: "Node Pool Management"
      value: "AKS supports multiple node pools with different VM sizes, autoscaling policies, and OS types for workload-specific optimization"
    - key: "Azure Integration"
      value: "Native integration with Azure AD, Azure Monitor, Azure Policy, and Azure Container Registry for identity, observability, and governance"

    Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is Microsoft Azure's managed Kubernetes container orchestration
    platform that automates deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications.
    AKS manages the Kubernetes control plane including the API server, etcd, scheduler, and
    controllers as a fully managed service. It supports multiple node pools with autoscaling,
    integrates natively with Azure Active Directory for RBAC, Azure Monitor for observability,

    operational overhead by handling version upgrades, health monitoring, and node provisioning
    automatically, enabling teams to focus on application workloads.
