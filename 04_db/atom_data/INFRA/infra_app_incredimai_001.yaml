definition:
  what: >-
    IncrediMail was a Windows email client known for its animated and multimedia-rich email
    composition features. The application supported POP3, IMAP, and SMTP protocols for
    connecting to email servers. IncrediMail shut down operations in March 2020, with the
    company discontinuing all services and support. The client stored email data, account
    credentials, and contact information locally on the user's system.
  why: >-
    IncrediMail is a security concern as a discontinued email client that is no longer receiving
    security updates. Systems still running IncrediMail have unpatched vulnerabilities and use
    an unsupported email client handling sensitive communications. IncrediMail stored email
    credentials locally, making them targets for credential theft. The software's bundled
    adware and tracking behaviors raised privacy concerns during its active period.
    Infostealers specifically target IncrediMail credential storage for email account harvesting.
  how: >-
    IncrediMail operated as a Windows desktop email client connecting to mail servers through
    POP3/IMAP for retrieval and SMTP for sending. It stored account credentials, email data,
    and contacts in proprietary file formats within the user's AppData directory. The client
    rendered HTML email with embedded multimedia content. Credential extraction targets the
    IncrediMail data directories where account passwords are stored with weak or reversible
    encryption. Infostealer malware families include IncrediMail as a targeted application
    for credential harvesting alongside other email clients and browsers.

    IncrediMail was a Windows email client with multimedia features that shut down operations
    in March 2020. It supported POP3, IMAP, and SMTP protocols and stored credentials locally
    with weak encryption. IncrediMail is a security concern as discontinued software with no
    security updates, leaving remaining installations permanently vulnerable. Infostealer
    malware specifically targets IncrediMail credential storage for email account harvesting.
    The client stored data in proprietary formats within AppData directories. Security teams
    should identify and remove IncrediMail installations from organizational systems, migrate
    users to supported email clients, and scan for credential compromise on systems where
    IncrediMail was previously installed.
