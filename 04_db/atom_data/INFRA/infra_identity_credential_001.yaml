definition:
  what: >-
    A Credential Management System is an infrastructure component that provides centralized
    storage, lifecycle management, rotation, and secure distribution of authentication
    credentials including passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, and SSH keys. It
    abstracts credential operations from applications, enforcing security policies such as
    rotation schedules, complexity requirements, and access controls while providing audit
    trails for all credential access and modification events.
  why: >-
    Credential management systems are critical because compromised credentials are the
    leading initial access vector in security breaches. Hard-coded credentials, shared
    passwords, unrotated service account keys, and credential sprawl across configuration
    files are common attack targets. Centralized credential management reduces these risks
    by eliminating credential proliferation and enforcing automated rotation. However, the
    credential management system itself becomes a high-value target, requiring robust
    access controls, encryption, and monitoring to prevent credential database compromise.
  how: >-
    Credential management systems store credentials in encrypted databases or vaults,
    providing APIs for credential retrieval, rotation, and lifecycle management. Applications
    authenticate to the credential system to obtain credentials at runtime rather than
    storing them locally. The system enforces password policies, schedules automated
    rotation, manages certificate renewal, and handles SSH key distribution. Access is
    controlled through authentication and authorization policies with full audit logging.
    Integration with identity providers enables SSO for credential system access, and
    break-glass procedures provide emergency access capabilities.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Automated Credential Rotation"
      value: "Scheduled automatic rotation of passwords, keys, and certificates reducing the exposure window of compromised credentials"
    - key: "Centralized Credential Store"
      value: "Single source of truth for credentials eliminating hard-coded secrets and credential sprawl across applications and configurations"
    - key: "Runtime Credential Injection"
      value: "Applications retrieve credentials at runtime through APIs rather than storing them statically, reducing credential exposure"

    A Credential Management System provides centralized storage, lifecycle management,
    rotation, and secure distribution of authentication credentials including passwords,
    API keys, tokens, certificates, and SSH keys. It abstracts credential operations from
    applications, enforcing rotation schedules, complexity requirements, and access controls
    with audit trails. Compromised credentials are the leading initial access vector in
    breaches, making centralized credential management essential. The system eliminates
    hard-coded credentials and credential sprawl by providing runtime credential injection
    through APIs. However, the credential system itself is a high-value target requiring
    robust encryption, access controls, and monitoring. Security teams must implement
    automated rotation, enforce least-privilege access to credentials, audit credential
    retrieval patterns, protect the credential database with encryption, and maintain
    break-glass procedures for emergency access scenarios.
