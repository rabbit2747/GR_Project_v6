definition:
  what: >-
    GuardLogix is Rockwell Automation's safety-rated programmable automation controller (PAC)
    built on the ControlLogix platform. It combines standard control functionality with SIL 3
    (Safety Integrity Level 3, IEC 61508) and PLe (Performance Level e, ISO 13849) certified
    safety control in a single controller. GuardLogix uses the same 1756 chassis, EtherNet/IP
    network, and Studio 5000 programming environment as ControlLogix but adds a dedicated
    safety co-processor and safety-certified I/O modules for emergency stop, light curtain,
    safety interlock, and safeguarding functions.
  why: >-
    GuardLogix safety controllers are the highest-value targets in ICS environments because
    they directly protect human life and equipment through safety interlock functions. Compromise
    or manipulation of safety controllers can disable emergency shutdowns, mask hazardous
    conditions, or allow unsafe operating parameters, potentially causing industrial accidents,
    injuries, or fatalities. The TRITON/TRISIS attack on Schneider Triconex demonstrated the
    real-world threat to safety instrumented systems. GuardLogix shares ControlLogix vulnerabilities
    in CIP and EtherNet/IP while also requiring protection of safety-specific program integrity.
  how: >-
    GuardLogix operates using dual processors: a standard Logix5000 processor for process
    control and a dedicated safety co-processor that independently validates safety-related
    computations. Both processors must agree on safety outputs for safe operation. Safety
    programs are written using safety-certified function blocks and structured text in Studio
    5000 Logix Designer with safety task configurations. CIP Safety protocol extensions provide
    authenticated and integrity-checked communication between safety I/O modules and the
    controller over standard EtherNet/IP networks. Safety program changes require authentication
    and may require physical key switch authorization.
