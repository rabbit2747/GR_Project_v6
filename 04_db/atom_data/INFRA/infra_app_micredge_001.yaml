# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Microsoft Edge is a Chromium-based web browser developed by Microsoft, replacing the
    legacy Edge (EdgeHTML) and Internet Explorer as the default Windows browser. Since its
    Chromium rewrite in 2020, Edge shares the Blink rendering engine with Google Chrome and
    supports Chrome extensions. Edge includes enterprise management features, Microsoft 365
    integration, IE mode for legacy compatibility, and built-in security features like
    Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. It stores credentials, cookies, and browsing data in the
    standard Chromium profile format with DPAPI encryption on Windows.
  why: >-
    Microsoft Edge is a primary target for credential theft by infostealer malware due to its
    position as the default Windows browser with high market share. Major infostealers
    (RedLine, Raccoon, Vidar, LummaC2) target Edge's Chromium-based credential stores alongside
    Chrome. Edge inherits Chromium engine vulnerabilities and has a rapid CVE disclosure cadence.
    Edge's IE mode maintains the legacy MSHTML attack surface within a modern browser. Enterprise
    deployments with synchronized profiles create lateral credential exposure risks. Edge's deep
    Windows integration through COM and WebView2 creates additional attack vectors.
  how: >-
    Microsoft Edge renders web content using the Chromium Blink engine and V8 JavaScript engine.
    Credentials are stored in the Login Data SQLite database encrypted with DPAPI, and cookies
    in the Cookies database with AES-256-GCM encryption using a key stored in the Local State
    file. Infostealer malware targets Edge profile directories at known filesystem paths to
    extract credentials, cookies, and autofill data. Edge's IE mode invokes the MSHTML rendering
    engine for legacy sites, maintaining the Trident attack surface. WebView2 embeds Edge's
    rendering engine in desktop applications, extending the browser attack surface into native
    applications. Exploitation targets include V8 engine vulnerabilities, extension abuse, and
    SmartScreen bypasses.

  embedding_text: >-
    Microsoft Edge is a Chromium-based web browser and the default Windows browser, replacing
    Internet Explorer and legacy EdgeHTML. It shares the Blink rendering engine with Chrome and
    stores credentials in DPAPI-encrypted SQLite databases. Edge is a primary target for
    infostealer malware families including RedLine, Raccoon, Vidar, and LummaC2 for credential
    and cookie harvesting. Edge inherits Chromium engine vulnerabilities and maintains legacy
    MSHTML attack surface through built-in IE mode. WebView2 extends Edge's rendering engine
    into desktop applications. Enterprise deployments with synchronized profiles create lateral
    credential exposure risks. Security teams should enforce browser security policies, monitor
    for credential extraction from Edge profile directories, manage IE mode access, keep Edge
    updated for Chromium security patches, and implement controls against infostealer malware.
