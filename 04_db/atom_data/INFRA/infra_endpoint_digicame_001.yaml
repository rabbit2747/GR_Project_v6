# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    A digital camera in the cybersecurity infrastructure context refers to network-connected
    imaging devices including IP surveillance cameras, CCTV systems, webcams, and IoT camera
    devices. These endpoints capture video and image data, often streaming over RTSP, ONVIF,
    or HTTP protocols to network video recorders (NVRs) or cloud storage. Common manufacturers
    include Hikvision, Dahua, Axis Communications, and Amcrest. Modern IP cameras run embedded
    Linux or RTOS firmware and expose web management interfaces, RTSP streams, and API endpoints.
  why: >-
    Network cameras are among the most commonly compromised IoT devices. Default credentials,
    unpatched firmware, and exposed management interfaces make them prime targets for botnets
    (Mirai), unauthorized surveillance, and network pivot points. Compromised cameras enable
    physical security bypass through surveillance feed manipulation, provide initial network
    access footholds, and may be enrolled into DDoS botnets. Camera firmware vulnerabilities
    have been widely exploited (CVE-2017-7921 Hikvision, CVE-2021-36260 Hikvision) enabling
    remote code execution.
  how: >-
    Digital cameras connect to networks via Ethernet or Wi-Fi and stream video using RTSP, ONVIF,
    or proprietary protocols. They run embedded operating systems (typically Linux-based) with
    web servers for management interfaces. Video feeds are compressed using H.264/H.265 codecs
    and transmitted to NVRs or cloud services. Management occurs through web browsers, mobile
    apps, or centralized video management systems. Security controls include HTTPS for management,
    RTSP authentication, firmware update mechanisms, and network segmentation to isolate camera
    networks from production systems.

    - key: "IoT Attack Surface"
      value: "Cameras present large attack surfaces with web interfaces, streaming protocols, firmware update mechanisms, and often default credentials"
    - key: "Botnet Recruitment"
      value: "Mirai and derivative botnets specifically target IP cameras using default credentials for DDoS attack infrastructure"
    - key: "Physical Security Integration"
      value: "Network cameras bridge cyber and physical security domains, making their compromise a dual-domain security incident"

    Digital Camera in the cybersecurity context refers to network-connected imaging devices
    including IP surveillance cameras, CCTV systems, and IoT camera endpoints manufactured by
    Hikvision, Dahua, Axis, and others. These devices run embedded Linux firmware and expose
    web management interfaces, RTSP streams, and API endpoints. Network cameras are among the
    most commonly compromised IoT devices due to default credentials, unpatched firmware, and
    exposed management interfaces. They are prime targets for botnets like Mirai, enable
    physical security bypass through surveillance feed manipulation, and provide network pivot
    points. Critical vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-7921 and CVE-2021-36260 in Hikvision cameras
    have enabled remote code execution. Security controls include network segmentation, firmware
    updates, credential management, and RTSP authentication.
