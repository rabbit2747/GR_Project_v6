# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Service Desk software provides IT Service Management (ITSM) capabilities including incident
    management, problem tracking, change management, asset management, and knowledge base
    functionality. These platforms serve as the central hub for IT support operations, managing
    tickets, workflows, SLAs, and communication between IT teams and end users. Common examples
    include Jira Service Management, Freshdesk, Zendesk, and ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus.
  why: >-
    Service desk platforms accumulate sensitive operational data including system configurations,
    credential reset workflows, network diagrams, and vulnerability reports in knowledge base
    articles. Compromised service desk accounts can be leveraged for social engineering by
    impersonating IT support staff. Password reset workflows in service desks can be exploited
    for account takeover if verification is insufficient. Ticket contents often contain
    sensitive information such as error logs with credentials, configuration details, and
    security incident reports accessible to authenticated users with broad permissions.
  how: >-
    Service desk platforms typically operate as web applications with REST APIs, using role-based
    access control for ticket management. They integrate with directory services (LDAP/AD) for
    authentication, email systems for ticket creation via email, and monitoring tools for
    automatic incident creation. Workflows automate ticket routing, escalation, and notification.
    Knowledge bases store searchable articles accessible to various user roles. API integrations
    connect with CMDB, monitoring, and automation platforms.

  embedding_text: >-
    Service Desk platforms provide IT Service Management including incident tracking, change
    management, asset management, and knowledge base functionality. These web-based applications
    integrate with directory services, email, and monitoring tools. Security concerns include
    sensitive data aggregation in tickets containing credentials and configuration details,
    social engineering through compromised IT support accounts, password reset workflow
    exploitation for account takeover, and knowledge base articles exposing system architecture
    and vulnerability information. Service desks use RBAC and integrate with LDAP/AD for
    authentication. Security teams should enforce least-privilege access, implement strong
    verification for password resets, audit ticket content for sensitive data exposure, and
    monitor for unauthorized API access to service desk platforms.
