definition:
  what: "Try Cloudflare (trycloudflare.com) is a free service from Cloudflare that creates temporary, unauthenticated reverse tunnels to expose local services to the internet without requiring a Cloudflare account, domain ownership, or DNS configuration. By running the cloudflared tunnel command with no arguments, users receive a randomly generated trycloudflare.com subdomain that proxies HTTPS traffic from the internet to the local service. The tunnel operates through Cloudflare's global edge network, providing TLS encryption, DDoS protection, and Cloudflare's CDN infrastructure for the temporary endpoint. These tunnels are ephemeral, lasting only as long as the cloudflared process runs, and use randomized subdomains that cannot be predicted in advance."
  why: "Try Cloudflare is security-relevant for two reasons. Legitimately, it enables developers to quickly expose local development servers for testing, webhooks, and demonstrations without complex firewall or DNS configuration. However, it has become a significant concern in cybersecurity because threat actors abuse it to create disposable command-and-control channels, host phishing pages, deliver malware payloads, and exfiltrate data through Cloudflare's trusted infrastructure. Because the traffic originates from Cloudflare IP ranges that are widely trusted and allowlisted, malicious tunnels can bypass network security controls, domain reputation filters, and TLS inspection. The temporary and anonymous nature of these tunnels makes attribution and takedown difficult."
  how: "A user downloads the cloudflared binary and runs a single command to establish a tunnel. The cloudflared process creates an outbound connection from the local machine to Cloudflare's edge network, avoiding the need for inbound firewall rules. Cloudflare assigns a random trycloudflare.com subdomain and configures its edge to proxy all HTTPS requests for that subdomain through the tunnel to the local service. The local service receives the proxied requests as if they were local connections. No authentication or account creation is required. Threat actors leverage this by running cloudflared on compromised hosts to establish outbound-only tunnels for C2, hosting phishing content behind trusted Cloudflare TLS certificates, or creating temporary file hosting for malware distribution. Detection requires monitoring for cloudflared process execution and connections to trycloudflare.com domains."

    - key: "Trusted Infrastructure Abuse"
      value: "The exploitation of Cloudflare's globally trusted IP ranges and TLS certificates to bypass domain reputation filters, network security controls, and allowlist-based defenses"
