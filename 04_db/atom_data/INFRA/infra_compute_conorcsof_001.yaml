definition:
  what: >-
    Container Orchestration Software automates the deployment, scaling, networking, and management
    of containerized applications across clusters of hosts. It handles scheduling containers to
    available nodes, maintaining desired replica counts, performing rolling updates, managing
    service discovery and load balancing, and ensuring container health through liveness and
    readiness probes. Kubernetes is the dominant container orchestrator, with alternatives
    including Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, and Nomad.
  why: >-
    Container orchestration is essential infrastructure for running containers at scale in
    production. From a security perspective, orchestrators control container placement, network
    policies, secret management, RBAC, and pod security standards. A compromised orchestrator
    can deploy malicious containers, exfiltrate secrets, modify network policies, and control
    all workloads in the cluster. Securing the orchestration layer is critical to container
    security.
  how: >-
    Container orchestrators operate through a control plane that manages cluster state and a
    data plane where workloads run. The control plane includes an API server, scheduler,
    controller manager, and state store (etcd in Kubernetes). Workloads are defined as
    declarative specifications (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets) and the orchestrator
    reconciles actual state with desired state. Networking is handled through CNI plugins,
    service meshes, and network policies.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Declarative State Management"
      value: "Users declare desired workload state and the orchestrator continuously reconciles actual state to match through control loops"
    - key: "Scheduling and Placement"
      value: "Intelligent placement of containers on cluster nodes based on resource requirements, constraints, affinity rules, and availability"
    - key: "Service Discovery"
      value: "Automatic DNS-based service discovery and load balancing enabling container-to-container communication without hardcoded addresses"
