  what: >-
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers
    over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. AWS provides on-demand compute power,
    database storage, content delivery, and other functionality including IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings.
    Launched in 2006 with Amazon S3 and EC2, AWS has grown to become the world's most widely adopted
    cloud platform, holding approximately 31% of the global cloud infrastructure market share. AWS
    operates across 33 geographic regions with 105 Availability Zones, providing services including
    compute (EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS), storage (S3, EBS, EFS), databases (RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora),
    networking (VPC, CloudFront, Route 53), security (IAM, GuardDuty, Security Hub, KMS), and
    machine learning (SageMaker, Bedrock). AWS follows a shared responsibility model where Amazon
    manages security of the cloud infrastructure while customers are responsible for security in the cloud.
  why: >-
    AWS is the dominant cloud infrastructure provider and a critical attack surface in modern enterprise
    environments. Misconfigured AWS services (S3 buckets, IAM policies, security groups) are among the
    most common sources of data breaches. Understanding AWS architecture is essential for both offensive
    security (cloud pentesting, red team operations) and defensive security (cloud security posture
    management, incident response). The shared responsibility model creates a boundary where security
    gaps frequently occur due to customer misconfiguration.
  how: >-
    AWS services are accessed through the AWS Management Console (web UI), AWS CLI, SDKs, or direct
    API calls authenticated via IAM credentials (access keys, session tokens, or IAM roles). Resources
    are organized within AWS accounts, which can be grouped under AWS Organizations for centralized
    governance. Network isolation is achieved through VPCs with subnets, security groups, and NACLs.
    Identity and access management uses IAM policies (JSON documents) that define permissions following
    the principle of least privilege. Logging and monitoring are provided through CloudTrail (API audit),
    CloudWatch (metrics/logs), and GuardDuty (threat detection). Encryption is available at rest (KMS)
    and in transit (TLS/ACM).
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Shared Responsibility Model"
      value: "AWS manages security OF the cloud (physical, hypervisor, network); customers manage security IN the cloud (data, IAM, application, OS patching)"
    - name: "IAM (Identity and Access Management)"
      value: "Fine-grained access control using users, groups, roles, and JSON policy documents with explicit allow/deny statements"
    - name: "VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)"
      value: "Isolated virtual network with subnets, route tables, security groups, and NACLs providing network segmentation"
    - name: "Availability Zones"
      value: "Physically separate data centers within a region providing fault tolerance and high availability"
    - name: "AWS Organizations"
      value: "Multi-account management with Service Control Policies (SCPs) for centralized governance and billing"

    Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud computing
    platform, offering over 200 services including compute (EC2, Lambda, ECS), storage (S3, EBS),
    databases (RDS, DynamoDB), networking (VPC, CloudFront), and security (IAM, GuardDuty, KMS).
    Operating across 33 regions with 105 Availability Zones, AWS follows a shared responsibility
    model where Amazon secures the cloud infrastructure while customers secure their workloads.
    AWS is critical in cybersecurity contexts because misconfigured services—particularly S3 buckets,
    IAM policies, and security groups—represent one of the most prevalent attack vectors in modern
    enterprises. Security capabilities include CloudTrail for API auditing, GuardDuty for threat
    detection, Security Hub for posture management, and KMS for encryption key management. AWS
    Organizations enables multi-account governance with Service Control Policies for centralized
    security enforcement across enterprise environments.
