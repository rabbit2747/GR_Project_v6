# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    A Disk Drive is a persistent storage device (HDD or SSD) that stores operating system files,
    applications, user data, and system configurations on a computer system. HDDs use magnetic
    platters with read/write heads, while SSDs use NAND flash memory. Disk drives connect via
    SATA, NVMe, SAS, or USB interfaces and are organized with partition tables (MBR/GPT) and
    filesystems (NTFS, ext4, APFS, XFS) that manage data storage and retrieval.
  why: >-
    Disk drives contain all persistent data on a system including operating system artifacts,
    user files, application data, and forensic evidence. They are critical to cybersecurity for
    data-at-rest encryption (BitLocker, LUKS, FileVault), forensic acquisition and analysis,
    secure data destruction, and evidence preservation. Unencrypted disk drives from decommissioned
    systems are a leading cause of data breaches through physical theft or improper disposal.
  how: >-
    Disk drives store data in organized filesystem structures addressable by the operating system.
    Full-disk encryption (FDE) protects data at rest using AES encryption with keys managed by
    TPM chips or password-derived keys. Self-encrypting drives (SEDs) implement encryption in
    hardware. Forensic acquisition creates bit-for-bit images using tools like dd, FTK Imager,
    or EnCase. Secure erasure uses NIST 800-88 guidelines including cryptographic erase, block
    erase, or physical destruction.

    - key: "Secure Data Destruction"
      value: "NIST 800-88 compliant methods including cryptographic erase, block erase, and physical destruction for data sanitization"
