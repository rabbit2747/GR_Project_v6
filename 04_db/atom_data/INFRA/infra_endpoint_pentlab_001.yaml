definition:
  what: >-
    A Pentest Lab is an isolated infrastructure environment specifically designed for penetration
    testing practice, security tool development, exploit testing, and offensive security training.
    These environments may be physical networks with dedicated hardware, virtualized using
    VMware/VirtualBox/Proxmox, or cloud-hosted on platforms like AWS/Azure. Pentest labs
    typically contain intentionally vulnerable machines (Metasploitable, DVWA, VulnHub images),
    network segmentation for simulating enterprise architectures, and attack tools (Kali Linux,
    Parrot OS). Commercial platforms like Offensive Security labs, HackTheBox, and PentesterLab
    provide managed lab environments.
  why: >-
    Pentest labs are critical security infrastructure for training offensive and defensive
    security teams, validating security tools, testing exploits in controlled environments,
    and developing attack playbooks before live engagements. However, they also present security
    risks: misconfigured labs can expose vulnerable services to production networks, lab tools
    can be repurposed for unauthorized attacks, and lab infrastructure may contain sensitive
    client data from previous assessments. Air-gapping or strict network isolation of lab
    environments is essential to prevent accidental exposure or compromise.
  how: >-
    Pentest labs are constructed by deploying intentionally vulnerable operating systems and
    applications on isolated networks. Virtualization platforms host multiple target machines
    simulating different OS versions, services, and vulnerability classes. Network segmentation
    creates separate subnets mimicking DMZ, internal, and management zones. Attack machines
    run security distributions (Kali, Parrot) with pre-installed tools. Lab management may
    use automation tools (Vagrant, Terraform, Ansible) for reproducible environment deployment.
    Access is controlled through VPN connections, jump boxes, and time-limited sessions.
    Results are documented and environments are reset between assessments.
