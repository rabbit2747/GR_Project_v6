definition:
  what: >-
    AWS Verified Access is a zero trust network access service that provides secure access
    to corporate applications without requiring a VPN. It evaluates each access request
    against defined access policies using identity and device trust signals from AWS IAM
    Identity Center, third-party identity providers, and device management solutions. Verified
    Access acts as an application-layer gateway that enforces contextual access decisions
    based on user identity, device posture, and organizational policies before granting
    access to protected resources.
  why: >-
    Verified Access reduces the attack surface by eliminating broad network-level VPN access
    in favor of application-specific zero trust policies. However, misconfigured access
    policies, weak trust provider integrations, or overly permissive default rules can
    undermine the zero trust model. Attackers may attempt to bypass Verified Access through
    direct application access if security groups are not properly locked down, or exploit
    trust provider weaknesses to forge device posture signals. Proper configuration is
    essential to ensure the service actually enforces the intended zero trust posture.
  how: >-
    Verified Access instances are created with associated trust providers (identity providers
    and device trust providers). Access groups define sets of applications sharing common
    access requirements. Cedar-based access policies evaluate trust context including user
    attributes, group memberships, and device security posture for each request. Traffic
    flows through Verified Access endpoints that terminate TLS and enforce policy decisions
    before proxying requests to backend applications. Access logs are sent to CloudWatch,
    S3, or Kinesis for monitoring and compliance auditing.

  embedding_text: >-
    AWS Verified Access is a zero trust network access service that provides secure
    application access without VPNs by evaluating each request against Cedar-based access
    policies using identity and device trust signals. It integrates with AWS IAM Identity
    Center, third-party identity providers, and device management solutions to assess user
    identity, group memberships, and device security posture. Verified Access instances
    contain trust providers and access groups defining application sets with shared access
    requirements. Traffic flows through Verified Access endpoints that enforce policy
    decisions before proxying to backend applications. The service reduces attack surface
    by eliminating broad VPN access in favor of application-specific decisions. Security
    teams must properly configure access policies, lock down security groups to prevent
    direct bypass, validate trust provider integrations, and monitor access logs for
    anomalous patterns to maintain zero trust enforcement.
