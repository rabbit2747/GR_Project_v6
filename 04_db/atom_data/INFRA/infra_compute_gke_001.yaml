definition:
  what: >-
    Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed Kubernetes service on Google Cloud Platform
    that provides automated cluster provisioning, scaling, upgrades, and management. GKE
    offers Standard mode (user-managed node pools) and Autopilot mode (fully managed nodes).
    It integrates with GCP networking (VPC-native clusters), security (Workload Identity,
    Binary Authorization), and observability (Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring) services.
  why: >-
    GKE clusters are high-value targets due to the workloads they orchestrate. Security
    concerns include exposed Kubernetes API servers, overly permissive RBAC, container escape
    vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks through compromised container images, and metadata
    server credential theft from pods. GKE Autopilot reduces attack surface by restricting
    node-level access but introduces different trust boundaries. Workload Identity eliminates
    service account key exposure risks.
  how: >-
    GKE manages the Kubernetes control plane (API server, etcd, scheduler) while customers
    manage workloads. VPC-native networking provides pod IP addresses from VPC subnets.
    Workload Identity maps Kubernetes service accounts to GCP IAM service accounts without
    key files. Binary Authorization enforces container image signing policies. GKE Sandbox
    (gVisor) provides kernel-level container isolation. Shielded GKE nodes use Secure Boot
    and vTPM. Network policies and Anthos Service Mesh control pod-to-pod communication.
