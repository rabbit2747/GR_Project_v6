definition:
  what: >-
    Arch Linux is a lightweight, rolling-release Linux distribution that follows the KISS (Keep
    It Simple, Stupid) design philosophy. It provides a minimal base installation that users
    customize by installing only needed packages via the pacman package manager. Arch Linux
    targets experienced users who want full control over their system configuration and prefer
    building their environment from the ground up rather than using pre-configured distributions.
  why: >-
    Arch Linux serves as an infrastructure operating system for environments where minimal
    footprint, bleeding-edge packages, and granular system control are priorities. Its rolling
    release model means systems always run the latest software versions without major upgrade
    cycles. In cybersecurity contexts, Arch Linux is commonly used in penetration testing
    environments, security research workstations, and as a base for custom security tooling
    due to its extensive package repository and AUR (Arch User Repository).
  how: >-
    Arch Linux is installed from a minimal ISO using a manual installation process that involves
    partitioning, filesystem creation, base package installation via pacstrap, and bootloader
    configuration. The pacman package manager handles binary packages from official repositories,
    while the AUR provides community-maintained build scripts. System configuration is performed
    through plain text configuration files. The systemd init system manages services and boot.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Rolling Release Model"
      value: "Continuous package updates without discrete version releases, keeping all software at the latest stable version"
    - key: "Pacman Package Manager"
      value: "Binary package manager that handles dependency resolution, with the AUR extending available packages through community build scripts"
    - key: "Minimal Base Installation"
      value: "Ships with only essential packages, requiring users to explicitly install and configure every component of their system"

  embedding_text: >-
    Arch Linux is a lightweight rolling-release Linux distribution following the KISS design
    philosophy that provides a minimal base installation for users who want full control over
    system configuration. It uses the pacman package manager for binary packages and the Arch
    User Repository (AUR) for community-maintained build scripts. The rolling release model
    delivers continuous updates without major version upgrades. Arch Linux is relevant in
    cybersecurity as a base for penetration testing environments, security research workstations,
    and custom security tooling due to its extensive package availability, minimal attack surface
    from the base install, and granular configuration control.
