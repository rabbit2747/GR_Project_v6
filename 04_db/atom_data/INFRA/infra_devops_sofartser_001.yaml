definition:
  what: "Software Artifact Server is the general infrastructure category for systems that store, version, and distribute compiled software artifacts, build outputs, and dependency packages. This includes JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus Repository, Azure Artifacts, AWS CodeArtifact, and GitHub Packages. These servers manage artifacts across multiple package formats (Maven, npm, NuGet, PyPI, Docker, Helm) with metadata tracking, access controls, vulnerability scanning, and build provenance."
  why: "Artifact servers are critical supply chain infrastructure because they serve as the single source of truth for software components consumed by build pipelines and deployed to production. Compromised artifact servers enable injection of backdoored dependencies, replacement of legitimate builds with malicious versions, and unauthorized access to proprietary compiled code. Artifact server access controls determine who can publish and consume packages. Internal artifact proxying can prevent direct dependency on untrusted public registries."
  how: "Artifact servers operate as universal repository managers supporting multiple package formats through format-specific APIs. Remote repositories proxy external registries (PyPI, npm, Docker Hub) with caching and security scanning. Local repositories host internally developed packages. Virtual repositories aggregate remote and local sources into single endpoints. Build integration captures provenance metadata linking artifacts to source commits. Vulnerability scanning checks stored artifacts against CVE databases. Cleanup policies manage storage through retention rules. Replication distributes artifacts across sites for availability."

    - key: "Remote Proxy"
      value: "Caching proxy for external package registries that scans dependencies for vulnerabilities before allowing consumption"
