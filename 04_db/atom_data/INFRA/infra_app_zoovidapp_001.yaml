definition:
  what: >-
    Zoom is a cloud-based video conferencing and collaboration platform providing meetings,
    webinars, phone system (Zoom Phone), chat, whiteboard, and email services. Available
    as desktop clients (Windows, macOS, Linux), mobile apps (iOS, Android), web client,
    and room systems, Zoom supports end-to-end encrypted meetings, screen sharing, recording,
    breakout rooms, and extensive third-party integrations. Following rapid pandemic-driven
    adoption, Zoom serves hundreds of millions of users across enterprise, education,
    healthcare, and government sectors.
  why: >-
    Zoom has experienced significant security incidents including the "Zoombombing" phenomenon
    (unauthorized meeting access), discovery of UNC path injection vulnerabilities enabling
    credential theft on Windows, and routing of encryption keys through Chinese data centers
    raising sovereignty concerns. The Zoom client has had critical vulnerabilities including
    CVE-2022-28756 (macOS local privilege escalation through auto-updater) and CVE-2023-28597
    (improper trust boundary implementation). Meeting recordings stored in cloud or local
    storage may contain sensitive business, medical, or legal information. The Zoom installer
    and auto-update mechanism have been exploited for local privilege escalation. Zoom's
    widespread enterprise adoption makes client vulnerabilities high-impact.
  how: >-
    Zoom operates through cloud infrastructure with global data centers. Desktop clients
    connect via HTTPS for signaling and use UDP/TCP for media transport with SRTP encryption.
    End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is available using the Zoom Messaging Layer Security
    protocol. Authentication supports SAML 2.0 SSO, OAuth, and native credentials with
    optional MFA. Meetings use numeric IDs with optional passcodes and waiting rooms.
    The Zoom SDK enables embedded video capabilities in third-party applications. Zoom
    Phone provides PSTN connectivity through SIP trunking. Administrative controls manage
    meeting policies, recording permissions, data residency, and compliance features
    including archiving and legal hold.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Client-Side Vulnerability Impact"
      value: "Zoom desktop client vulnerabilities including auto-updater privilege escalation and UNC path injection affect hundreds of millions of endpoints across enterprises"
    - key: "Meeting Security and Unauthorized Access"
      value: "Insufficient meeting security controls (no passcodes, no waiting rooms) enable Zoombombing and unauthorized access to confidential meetings and recordings"
    - key: "Data Sovereignty and Encryption Concerns"
      value: "Historical routing of encryption keys through Chinese data centers and evolving E2EE implementation raise data sovereignty and confidentiality concerns for sensitive organizations"

  embedding_text: >-
    Zoom is a cloud-based video conferencing platform with desktop, mobile, and web clients
    supporting E2EE meetings, phone, chat, and collaboration for hundreds of millions of
    users. Security concerns include Zoombombing (unauthorized meeting access), client
    vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-28756 macOS privilege escalation, UNC path injection for
    credential theft), and historical encryption key routing through Chinese data centers.
    Meeting recordings may contain sensitive business, medical, or legal information. The
    auto-updater has been exploited for privilege escalation. Security teams should keep
    Zoom clients updated, enforce meeting passcodes and waiting rooms, configure data
    residency settings, implement SSO with MFA, manage recording storage and access controls,
    and monitor for anomalous meeting access patterns and client exploitation attempts.
