definition:
  what: >-
    TransferNow is a French cloud-based file transfer service that enables users to send and
    receive large files (up to 5GB free, 50GB premium) via web interface without requiring
    recipient registration. The platform provides temporary file hosting with configurable
    expiration periods, download notifications, password protection, and a file storage
    workspace for premium users. It operates as a web application accessible through browsers
    on any platform.
  why: >-
    File transfer services like TransferNow are commonly abused for data exfiltration because
    they allow uploading large volumes of data to external cloud storage through standard
    HTTPS connections that bypass traditional network security controls. Attackers use these
    services to stage stolen data for retrieval. Phishing campaigns distribute malicious files
    through TransferNow links that appear as legitimate file transfer notifications. The
    temporary nature of hosted files (auto-deletion) can complicate forensic investigation.
    Employee use of unapproved file transfer services creates shadow IT and data leakage risks.
  how: >-
    TransferNow operates through a web interface at transfernow.net. Users upload files which
    are stored on TransferNow's cloud infrastructure (hosted in France/EU). Recipients receive
    email notifications with download links. Files are transmitted over HTTPS and stored with
    server-side encryption. Premium features include password protection, custom expiration,
    and download tracking. The service does not require authentication for basic transfers,
    lowering the barrier for both legitimate use and abuse.

    TransferNow is a French cloud-based file transfer service allowing large file sending
    (5GB free, 50GB premium) without recipient registration. Files are hosted temporarily
    on EU-based infrastructure with HTTPS transmission and server-side encryption. Security
    concerns include use as a data exfiltration channel bypassing network controls, malware
    distribution through transfer links, ephemeral file hosting complicating forensics, and
    shadow IT risks from unapproved employee usage. Unauthenticated basic transfers lower
    barriers for abuse. Security teams should monitor for transfers to file sharing services,
    implement DLP controls, consider blocking unapproved file transfer platforms, and educate
    users about approved data sharing channels.
