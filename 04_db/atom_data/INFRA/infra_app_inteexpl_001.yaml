definition:
  what: >-
    Internet Explorer (IE) is Microsoft's legacy web browser that was integrated into Windows
    operating systems from 1995 until its official retirement in June 2022. IE used the
    Trident (MSHTML) rendering engine and supported ActiveX controls, Browser Helper Objects
    (BHOs), and VBScript. While officially retired, the MSHTML engine remains in Windows
    for backward compatibility, and IE mode in Edge provides legacy web application support.
  why: >-
    Internet Explorer has an extensive history of critical security vulnerabilities and was one
    of the most targeted applications for drive-by download attacks. The MSHTML engine continues
    to be exploited even after IE retirement, as demonstrated by CVE-2023-36884 and CVE-2024-38112
    where attackers used MHTML URL handlers to invoke MSHTML. ActiveX and BHO architectures
    enabled extensive malware through malicious controls and browser extensions. IE's scripting
    engines (JScript, VBScript) were primary exploitation targets. Legacy enterprise applications
    still requiring IE mode represent ongoing risk.
  how: >-
    Internet Explorer processed web content through the Trident/MSHTML rendering engine with
    JScript and VBScript scripting engines. ActiveX controls provided native code execution from
    web pages. The browser integrated with Windows through COM, allowing deep OS interaction.
    Post-retirement exploitation targets the MSHTML engine through URL protocol handlers
    (ms-msdt, search-ms, mhtml) that invoke MSHTML for content rendering even without IE.
    Malware continues exploiting MSHTML vulnerabilities through crafted Office documents and
    URL files that trigger the legacy rendering engine. IE mode in Edge maintains the MSHTML
    attack surface for legacy compatibility.

  embedding_text: >-
    Internet Explorer is Microsoft's legacy web browser retired in June 2022, using the
    Trident/MSHTML rendering engine with ActiveX and VBScript support. Despite retirement,
    the MSHTML engine persists in Windows and continues to be actively exploited through URL
    protocol handlers (mhtml, ms-msdt, search-ms) and Office document embedding. ActiveX
    controls enabled native code execution from web pages. IE had an extensive vulnerability
    history as a primary target for drive-by downloads. CVE-2023-36884 and CVE-2024-38112
    demonstrate ongoing MSHTML exploitation. IE mode in Edge maintains the legacy attack
    surface. Security teams should disable MSHTML URL handlers, block ActiveX, monitor for
    MSHTML engine invocation, and migrate legacy applications away from IE mode where possible.
