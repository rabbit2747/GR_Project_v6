definition:
  what: >-
    FortiWeb is Fortinet's Web Application Firewall (WAF) product line providing protection for
    web applications and APIs against OWASP Top 10 attacks, DDoS, bot attacks, and API abuse.
    Available as hardware appliances, virtual machines, containers, and FortiWeb Cloud SaaS.
    FortiWeb uses machine learning-based threat detection to identify anomalous traffic patterns
    and reduce false positives compared to traditional signature-based WAFs.
  why: >-
    FortiWeb protects internet-facing web applications and APIs that are primary attack vectors
    for data breaches. It defends against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, file inclusion, and API
    attacks. FortiWeb itself has had critical vulnerabilities including CVE-2021-22123 (OS
    command injection) and CVE-2020-29015 (SQL injection in management interface) that could
    allow attackers to bypass the very security control designed to protect web applications.
  how: >-
    FortiWeb operates as a reverse proxy or transparent bridge inspecting HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
    Machine learning models profile normal application behavior and detect anomalies. Signature
    engine matches known attack patterns. API protection validates schemas and enforces rate
    limits. Bot detection uses fingerprinting, CAPTCHA, and behavioral analysis. Integration
    with FortiGate, FortiSandbox, and FortiGuard threat intelligence provides coordinated
    defense. Management via FortiWeb Manager or Fortinet Security Fabric.
