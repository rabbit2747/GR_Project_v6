definition:
  what: >-
    GlassFish is an open-source Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) application server that serves
    as the reference implementation for the Jakarta EE specification. Originally developed by
    Sun Microsystems and later Oracle, it is now maintained by the Eclipse Foundation. GlassFish
    provides a full Java EE container supporting servlets, JSP, EJB, JPA, JMS, JAX-RS, and
    other enterprise Java specifications. Payara Server is a commercially supported fork.
  why: >-
    GlassFish has been subject to critical vulnerabilities including directory traversal
    (CVE-2017-1000028), remote code execution through deserialization flaws, and admin console
    exposure. The admin console listens on port 4848 by default and may use default or weak
    credentials. As a Java application server, GlassFish inherits Java deserialization
    vulnerabilities that enable remote code execution. Production deployments that use GlassFish
    as a standalone server expose additional attack surface through its HTTP listener and admin
    interfaces.
  how: >-
    GlassFish operates as a Java process hosting the Jakarta EE container. It deploys
    applications as WAR/EAR packages, managing their lifecycle through the admin console
    (port 4848) or asadmin CLI. The server provides HTTP listeners (ports 8080/8181),
    connection pooling, transaction management, and security realms. Exploitation targets the
    admin console through default credentials, Java deserialization in various components, and
    directory traversal vulnerabilities in file serving components.

  embedding_text: >-
    GlassFish is an open-source Jakarta EE application server serving as the reference
    implementation, now maintained by the Eclipse Foundation. It provides a full Java EE
    container supporting servlets, EJB, JPA, JMS, and other enterprise specifications.
    Security concerns include admin console exposure on port 4848 with potentially weak
    credentials, Java deserialization vulnerabilities enabling remote code execution, and
    directory traversal flaws (CVE-2017-1000028). Payara Server is a commercial fork. As
    with all Java application servers, GlassFish inherits platform-level deserialization
    risks. Security teams should restrict admin console access, deploy behind reverse
    proxies, and maintain current patch levels.
