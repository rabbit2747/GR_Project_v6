definition:
  what: >-
    TeraBox (formerly Dubox) is a cloud storage service developed by Flextech Inc., a subsidiary
    of Baidu, offering 1TB of free cloud storage. Available as a web application, desktop
    client, and mobile app for Android and iOS, it provides file storage, sharing, backup,
    and synchronization capabilities. The service is the international version of Baidu NetDisk,
    one of China's largest cloud storage platforms.
  why: >-
    TeraBox presents significant data sovereignty and privacy concerns due to its affiliation
    with Baidu and potential data storage in Chinese-jurisdiction data centers. The generous
    free storage offering (1TB) makes it attractive for data exfiltration by malicious insiders
    or attackers. The service has been used as a staging platform for malware distribution and
    phishing campaigns. Corporate environments face shadow IT risks when employees use TeraBox
    for work file storage outside sanctioned channels. The mobile app requests extensive device
    permissions that may collect data beyond storage needs.
  how: >-
    TeraBox operates through web interface (terabox.com), desktop applications for Windows
    and macOS, and mobile apps. Files are uploaded to cloud infrastructure and accessible
    across devices. The service provides shareable download links for file distribution,
    automatic photo/video backup from mobile devices, and folder synchronization. The API
    allows programmatic file management. Authentication uses email-based accounts with
    optional social login integration. Files are stored with server-side encryption, though
    the encryption keys are managed by the service provider.

    - key: "Shadow IT Exposure"
      value: "Free generous storage attracts employee adoption outside IT-sanctioned channels, creating unmonitored data flows and compliance gaps"

  embedding_text: >-
    TeraBox (formerly Dubox) is a cloud storage service by Flextech (Baidu subsidiary) offering
    1TB free storage via web, desktop, and mobile apps. It is the international version of
    Baidu NetDisk. Security concerns include data sovereignty risks with potential Chinese
    jurisdiction data storage, use as a high-capacity data exfiltration channel, malware
    distribution through shareable links, shadow IT risks from employee adoption, and
    extensive mobile app permissions. Provider-managed encryption keys limit user control
    over data protection. Security teams should block or monitor TeraBox access, implement
    DLP controls for cloud storage services, and establish approved cloud storage alternatives
    to prevent shadow IT usage of services with questionable data sovereignty guarantees.
