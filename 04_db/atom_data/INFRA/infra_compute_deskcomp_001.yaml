definition:
  what: >-
    A Desktop Computer is a personal computing device designed for regular use at a fixed
    location, consisting of a processor, memory, storage, display adapter, and peripherals
    running a desktop operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). In enterprise environments,
    desktops serve as endpoints for user productivity, development, and administration tasks.
    They connect to corporate networks and cloud services, accessing sensitive data and
    internal resources through authenticated sessions.
  why: >-
    Desktop computers are the primary endpoint attack surface in enterprise environments,
    targeted through phishing, drive-by downloads, supply chain attacks, and physical access.
    They store cached credentials, browser sessions, SSH keys, VPN configurations, and local
    data. Compromised desktops serve as initial access points for lateral movement, privilege
    escalation, and data exfiltration. Endpoint security solutions (EDR, DLP, disk encryption)
    are deployed on desktops as frontline defenses.
  how: >-
    Desktop computers run operating systems that manage hardware resources and provide the
    execution environment for applications. Enterprise desktops are typically domain-joined
    (Active Directory) or MDM-managed, with Group Policy or configuration profiles enforcing
    security baselines. Security controls include disk encryption (BitLocker, FileVault),
    endpoint detection (EDR agents), host firewalls, application whitelisting, and patch
    management. Remote management is via RDP, SSH, or management agents.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Endpoint Security"
      value: "Desktop security encompasses EDR, disk encryption, host firewall, application control, and patch management as layered defenses"
    - key: "Credential Storage"
      value: "Desktops store cached domain credentials, browser passwords, SSH keys, and session tokens that are targeted by credential theft attacks"
    - key: "Initial Access Vector"
      value: "Desktops are the primary target for phishing, social engineering, and drive-by download attacks as entry points into enterprise networks"
