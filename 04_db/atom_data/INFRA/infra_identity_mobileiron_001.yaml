definition:
  what: >-
    MobileIron (now Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile) is a unified endpoint management (UEM)
    and mobile device management (MDM) platform that provides device enrollment, configuration
    management, application deployment, and security policy enforcement across iOS, Android,
    Windows, and macOS devices. MobileIron Core serves as the management server handling
    device enrollment, policy distribution, and compliance evaluation. MobileIron Sentry
    provides secure gateway access for managed devices to corporate resources.
  why: >-
    MobileIron infrastructure has been targeted by multiple critical vulnerabilities including
    CVE-2020-15505 (remote code execution), CVE-2021-36260 (authentication bypass), and
    other RCE and authentication bypass flaws. The MobileIron Core server is internet-facing
    by design for device enrollment, making it an attractive initial access target.
    Compromise of the MDM platform enables mass device management manipulation, deployment
    of malicious profiles, credential harvesting from managed devices, and remote wipe
    capabilities. APT actors have exploited MobileIron vulnerabilities for initial access
    to enterprise networks.
  how: >-
    MobileIron Core manages device lifecycles through enrollment, configuration, and
    retirement. Devices connect to MobileIron Core for policy updates, compliance checks,
    and application management. MobileIron Sentry acts as a gateway between managed devices
    and internal resources, providing conditional access based on device compliance.
    Configuration profiles define security policies including encryption requirements,
    passcode policies, VPN configurations, and certificate deployment. The admin portal
    provides centralized management for device fleet operations. MobileIron integrates
    with enterprise identity providers for authentication and directory services.

  embedding_text: >-
    MobileIron (Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile) is a UEM and MDM platform providing device
    enrollment, configuration management, application deployment, and security policy
    enforcement across mobile and desktop devices. MobileIron Core is the management server
    and Sentry provides secure gateway access. The platform has been targeted by critical
    vulnerabilities including CVE-2020-15505 (RCE) and authentication bypass flaws. The
    internet-facing enrollment endpoint makes it an attractive initial access target. MDM
    compromise enables mass malicious profile deployment, credential harvesting, and remote
    device control. APT actors have exploited MobileIron for enterprise network access.
    Security teams must maintain aggressive patching, restrict admin portal access, monitor
    for unauthorized profile deployments, implement network segmentation for MDM servers,
    and audit device enrollment for unauthorized additions.
