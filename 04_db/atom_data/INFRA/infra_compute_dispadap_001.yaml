definition:
  what: >-
    A Display Adapter (GPU/graphics card) is a hardware component that renders visual output
    for display on monitors. Modern GPUs contain dedicated processors, memory (VRAM), and
    firmware. In cybersecurity contexts, GPUs are relevant for their firmware attack surface,
    kernel-mode driver vulnerabilities, DMA access capabilities, and use in password cracking
    and cryptographic operations through CUDA/OpenCL compute capabilities.
  why: >-
    Display adapter drivers run in kernel mode, making driver vulnerabilities a path to kernel
    compromise and privilege escalation. GPU firmware can harbor persistent malware that
    survives OS reinstallation. GPUs with DMA access can read/write system memory. Additionally,
    GPU compute (CUDA, OpenCL) enables massively parallel password cracking, hash brute-forcing,
    and cryptocurrency mining in compromised environments.
  how: >-
    Display adapters interface with the CPU via PCIe bus, running kernel-mode drivers (NVIDIA,
    AMD, Intel). The driver stack includes user-mode and kernel-mode components. GPU firmware
    (VBIOS) initializes hardware during boot. Display adapter configuration is managed through
    vendor control panels and Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM). Security involves keeping
    drivers patched, monitoring GPU firmware integrity, and detecting unauthorized GPU compute
    usage indicating cryptomining or password cracking.
