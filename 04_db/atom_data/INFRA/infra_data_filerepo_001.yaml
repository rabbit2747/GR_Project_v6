definition:
  what: >-
    A File Repository is a centralized storage system designed to organize, manage, version,
    and provide access to files and documents. Unlike simple file shares, file repositories
    typically offer metadata management, versioning, search capabilities, access control, and
    workflow integration. Examples include document management systems (SharePoint, Alfresco),
    artifact repositories (Nexus, Artifactory, JFrog), code repositories (Git, SVN), and
    content management systems. File repositories may be on-premises, cloud-hosted, or hybrid.
  why: >-
    File repositories are high-value targets because they centralize organizational documents,
    intellectual property, source code, build artifacts, and sensitive data. Compromise can lead
    to data exfiltration, supply chain attacks (through poisoned artifacts), intellectual property
    theft, and information disclosure. Artifact repositories are particularly critical in DevOps
    environments as compromised packages or container images can propagate malware across the
    software supply chain. Access control misconfigurations on file repositories frequently
    expose sensitive documents.
  how: >-
    File repositories provide file upload, download, and management through web interfaces,
    APIs, or client applications. Files are stored on backend storage (local disk, NAS, SAN,
    or cloud object storage) with metadata stored in a database. Versioning tracks file
    changes over time. Access control lists or role-based permissions restrict who can read,
    write, or manage files. Search indexing enables content and metadata search. Integration
    with authentication providers (LDAP, SAML, OAuth) centralizes identity management.
    Audit logging tracks file access and modifications for compliance and forensics.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Centralized Document Management"
      value: >-
        File repositories aggregate organizational files with metadata, versioning, and
        search capabilities, providing structured access to documents that would otherwise
        be scattered across individual systems.
    - key: "Supply Chain Security"
      value: >-
        Artifact repositories (Nexus, Artifactory) are critical supply chain components where
        compromised packages or images can propagate malware to all consuming applications.
    - key: "Access Control and Audit"
      value: >-
        File repositories implement granular permissions and audit logging to control and
        track document access, supporting compliance and forensic investigation requirements.

    A File Repository is a centralized storage system for organizing, managing, versioning, and
    providing access to files and documents with metadata management and search capabilities.
    Examples include document management systems (SharePoint, Alfresco), artifact repositories
    (Nexus, Artifactory), and code repositories (Git). File repositories are high-value targets
    centralizing organizational documents, intellectual property, and sensitive data. Artifact
    repositories are critical in DevOps environments where compromised packages can propagate
    malware across the software supply chain. Access control, versioning, and audit logging
    protect file integrity and track access. Integration with authentication providers
    centralizes identity management. File repositories map to MITRE ATT&CK T1213 (Data from
    Information Repositories) as adversaries target centralized document stores for collection
    and exfiltration.
