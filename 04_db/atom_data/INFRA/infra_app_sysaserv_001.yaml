definition:
  what: >-
    SysAid is an IT Service Management (ITSM) and help desk platform providing incident
    management, asset management, remote control, patch management, and IT automation. It
    is available as both on-premises (SysAid Server) and cloud-hosted deployments. The
    platform includes agent-based endpoint management, a self-service portal for end users,
    knowledge base, and workflow automation capabilities. SysAid Server runs on Apache Tomcat
    with a backend database (typically MySQL or MSSQL).
  why: >-
    SysAid Server has been targeted by nation-state actors, notably in the 2023 campaign
    exploiting CVE-2023-47246, a zero-day path traversal vulnerability used by the Lace
    Tempest threat actor to deploy ransomware. The platform's combination of web application
    attack surface, file upload capabilities, and privileged access to managed endpoints makes
    it a high-value target. SysAid agents running on endpoints with SYSTEM privileges provide
    post-compromise lateral movement and code execution capabilities. The Tomcat-based
    architecture inherits Java web application vulnerabilities.
  how: >-
    SysAid Server operates as a Java web application on Apache Tomcat, typically accessible
    via HTTPS on port 8443. It manages endpoints through SysAid Agent software that
    communicates with the server for inventory, remote control, and patch deployment. The
    self-service portal allows end users to submit tickets via web interface. REST APIs
    enable integration with other ITSM tools. Asset discovery scans networks using WMI, SNMP,
    and agent-based collection. The database stores ticket data, asset inventories,
    configuration details, and user credentials.

  embedding_text: >-
    SysAid Server is an ITSM and help desk platform running on Apache Tomcat with endpoint
    agent management capabilities. It was targeted in a 2023 zero-day campaign (CVE-2023-47246)
    by Lace Tempest threat actor deploying ransomware through a path traversal vulnerability.
    SysAid agents running with SYSTEM privileges on endpoints enable lateral movement after
    server compromise. The platform concentrates IT asset data, credentials, and remote
    management capabilities. Security concerns include web application vulnerabilities in the
    Tomcat-based architecture, file upload abuse, privileged agent exploitation, and database
    exposure of credentials and asset data. Security teams should patch promptly, restrict
    network access, monitor for anomalous file uploads, and audit agent communications.
