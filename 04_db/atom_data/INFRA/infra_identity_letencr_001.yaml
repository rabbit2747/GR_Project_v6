definition:
  what: >-
    Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, open Certificate Authority operated by the Internet
    Security Research Group (ISRG) that issues Domain Validation (DV) TLS certificates using
    the ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) protocol. It provides short-lived
    90-day certificates with automated issuance and renewal, enabling widespread TLS adoption.
    Let's Encrypt is the largest public CA by volume, issuing certificates for hundreds of
    millions of websites and enabling encrypted HTTPS connections at scale.
  why: >-
    While Let's Encrypt has significantly improved internet encryption adoption, its automated
    issuance model creates security considerations. Attackers use Let's Encrypt certificates
    to add legitimacy to phishing sites, command-and-control infrastructure, and malicious
    domains because DV certificates only verify domain control, not organizational identity.
    The short certificate lifetime mitigates some risks but also means automated renewal
    failures can cause service outages. ACME account key compromise enables unauthorized
    certificate issuance for validated domains. Certificate Transparency logs provide
    monitoring capability for detecting unauthorized issuance.
  how: >-
    Let's Encrypt uses the ACME protocol (RFC 8555) for automated certificate lifecycle
    management. ACME clients (certbot, acme.sh, cert-manager) initiate certificate requests
    by proving domain control through HTTP-01 challenges (placing tokens at
    /.well-known/acme-challenge/), DNS-01 challenges (creating TXT records), or TLS-ALPN-01
    challenges. Upon successful validation, Let's Encrypt issues signed certificates.
    Automated renewal occurs before the 90-day expiration. Certificate Transparency (CT)
    logging is mandatory, publishing all issued certificates to public logs. Wildcard
    certificates require DNS-01 validation. Rate limits prevent abuse.

  embedding_text: >-
    Let's Encrypt is a free automated Certificate Authority operated by ISRG issuing Domain
    Validation TLS certificates via the ACME protocol. It provides 90-day short-lived
    certificates with automated issuance and renewal through challenges proving domain
    control (HTTP-01, DNS-01, TLS-ALPN-01). Let's Encrypt is the largest public CA by
    volume enabling widespread HTTPS adoption. However, its automated DV-only model means
    attackers can obtain valid TLS certificates for phishing sites and C2 infrastructure.
    ACME account key compromise enables unauthorized issuance. Certificate Transparency
    logging is mandatory, providing detection capability. Security teams should monitor CT
    logs for unauthorized certificate issuance, protect ACME account keys, automate renewal
    to prevent outages, and understand that DV certificates on adversary infrastructure
    appear legitimate to end users despite no organizational vetting.
