# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    SafeNet is Thales' (formerly Gemalto) product family for hardware security modules (HSMs),
    multi-factor authentication, and data encryption. Key products include SafeNet Luna HSMs
    for cryptographic key management, SafeNet Trusted Access for cloud-based identity and
    access management, SafeNet Authentication Service (SAS) for MFA, and SafeNet KeySecure
    for enterprise key management. SafeNet solutions protect cryptographic keys, certificates,
    and authentication credentials across on-premises and cloud environments.
  why: >-
    SafeNet HSMs protect the root of trust for PKI, code signing, database encryption, and
    payment processing systems. Compromise of HSM-managed keys can undermine all dependent
    cryptographic operations. SafeNet MFA solutions protect against credential-based attacks
    by requiring hardware tokens, smart cards, or mobile authenticators. Financial institutions,
    government agencies, and healthcare organizations rely on SafeNet for regulatory compliance
    with PCI DSS, FIPS 140-2/3, and eIDAS requirements.
  how: >-
    SafeNet Luna HSMs provide FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified tamper-resistant hardware for key
    generation, storage, and cryptographic operations. Keys never leave the HSM boundary.
    Network-attached HSMs (Luna Network HSM) support multiple clients via TLS-authenticated
    connections. SafeNet Trusted Access provides SSO and adaptive MFA using risk-based
    authentication policies. Authentication methods include OTP tokens, push notifications,
    certificate-based authentication, and FIDO2 security keys. APIs integrate with enterprise
    applications, PKI systems, and cloud services.
