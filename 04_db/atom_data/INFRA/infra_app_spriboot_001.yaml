definition:
  what: >-
    Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework by Pivotal/VMware that simplifies the
    creation of production-ready Spring applications with embedded web servers (Tomcat, Jetty,
    Undertow). It provides auto-configuration, starter dependencies, and an opinionated
    approach to building microservices and web applications. Spring Boot applications are
    self-contained JARs that include an embedded application server, eliminating the need
    for separate application server deployment.
  why: >-
    Spring Boot applications are frequently targeted through exposed Actuator endpoints that
    reveal environment variables, configuration properties (potentially including credentials),
    heap dumps containing sensitive data, and application health information. Spring Expression
    Language (SpEL) injection vulnerabilities enable remote code execution. The Spring4Shell
    vulnerability (CVE-2022-22965) demonstrated critical RCE risk in Spring Framework class
    loading. Java deserialization vulnerabilities in Spring components can lead to remote code
    execution. Misconfigured auto-configuration can expose debug endpoints and development
    features in production.
  how: >-
    Spring Boot applications start as Java processes with an embedded web server listening on
    configurable ports (default 8080). Auto-configuration detects classpath dependencies and
    configures beans accordingly. Spring Boot Actuator provides management endpoints at
    /actuator/* for health checks, metrics, environment, and configuration. Application
    properties are loaded from application.yml/properties files and environment variables.
    Security is configured through Spring Security with filter chains, authentication
    providers, and authorization rules. RESTful APIs typically use Spring MVC or WebFlux.

      value: "Spring Boot Actuator endpoints can expose environment variables, credentials, heap dumps, and configuration if not properly secured"
    - key: "SpEL Injection"
      value: "Spring Expression Language injection enables remote code execution through user-controlled input evaluated as SpEL expressions"
    - key: "Auto-Configuration Risks"
      value: "Spring Boot auto-configuration may enable development/debug features in production if profiles and dependencies are not properly managed"

  embedding_text: >-
    Spring Boot is a Java-based framework for building production-ready applications with
    embedded web servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow). It provides auto-configuration and
    starter dependencies for rapid microservice development. Security concerns include
    exposed Actuator endpoints revealing credentials and environment variables, Spring
    Expression Language (SpEL) injection enabling RCE, Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) class
    loading vulnerability, Java deserialization attacks, and misconfigured auto-configuration
    exposing debug features in production. Security teams should secure Actuator endpoints,
    validate SpEL input, manage Spring profiles properly, update dependencies regularly, and
    review auto-configuration for unintended feature exposure in production deployments.
