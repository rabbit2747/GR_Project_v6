definition:
  what: >-
    Oracle VirtualBox is a free, open-source Type 2 hypervisor that runs on Windows, macOS,
    Linux, and Solaris host operating systems. It enables running multiple guest operating
    systems in virtual machines simultaneously. VirtualBox supports hardware virtualization
    (VT-x, AMD-V), snapshots, shared folders, NAT/bridged/host-only networking, USB
    passthrough, and Guest Additions for improved guest OS integration. It is widely used for
    development, testing, malware analysis sandboxing, and educational environments.
  why: >-
    VirtualBox has security implications as both an attack target and a defensive tool.
    VM escape vulnerabilities in VirtualBox (CVE-2023-22098 and others) allow guest-to-host
    compromise through GPU emulation, network adapter, and USB controller bugs. Malware uses
    VirtualBox detection (CPUID checks, registry keys, device drivers) for sandbox evasion.
    Conversely, VirtualBox is used by security researchers for malware analysis sandboxing.
    Shared folder misconfigurations can expose host filesystem to compromised guest VMs.
  how: >-
    VirtualBox runs as a user-space application loading kernel modules (vboxdrv) for hardware
    virtualization. VMs are defined by XML configuration files and virtual disk images (VDI,
    VMDK, VHD). Guest Additions provide paravirtualized drivers for improved performance.
    Networking modes include NAT (default, isolated), bridged (host network access), host-only
    (isolated network), and internal (VM-to-VM only). VBoxManage CLI provides full management
    capability. Security hardening includes disabling USB passthrough, restricting shared
    folders, using host-only networking, and keeping VirtualBox updated to patch VM escape
    vulnerabilities.

      value: "Guest-to-host escape through VirtualBox emulation bugs (GPU, network, USB) enables compromising the host system from within a guest VM"
    - key: "Sandbox Evasion Detection"
      value: "Malware detects VirtualBox through CPUID strings, registry keys, driver presence, and MAC address prefixes to evade analysis sandboxes"
    - key: "Type 2 Hypervisor Security Model"
      value: "Running atop a host OS means VirtualBox inherits host security posture and is vulnerable to host-level attacks unlike Type 1 hypervisors"
