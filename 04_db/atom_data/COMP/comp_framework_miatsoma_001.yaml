# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    MITRE ATT&CK Software Mapping is the component of the ATT&CK knowledge base that catalogs
    and maps adversary software (malware and tools) to the specific ATT&CK techniques they
    implement. The software catalog contains over 700 entries categorized as either malware
    (purpose-built malicious code) or tools (legitimate or dual-use software used by adversaries),
    each linked to documented technique usage, associated threat groups, and behavioral
    descriptions. This mapping enables defenders to understand which techniques a specific
    piece of malware or tool employs, and conversely, which software implements a given
    technique.
  why: >-
    When security analysts encounter adversary tools or malware during incident response or
    threat hunting, they need to quickly understand the full range of capabilities that
    software possesses. Software mapping provides immediate context about what ATT&CK
    techniques a tool can execute, enabling rapid scoping of potential compromise extent,
    informed containment decisions, and targeted detection rule development. It also enables
    threat intelligence analysts to track tool evolution, understand adversary capability
    development, and predict future attack patterns based on the tool arsenal associated
    with specific threat groups.
  how: >-
    Software mapping is maintained through: (1) Analyzing malware samples and adversary tools
    to document their behavioral capabilities; (2) Mapping observed behaviors to specific
    ATT&CK techniques with evidence from threat intelligence reports, incident response
    findings, and malware analysis; (3) Linking software entries to the threat groups known
    to use them, creating adversary-tool-technique relationship chains; (4) Organizations
    use software mappings to create detection rules targeting specific tool behaviors, scope
    incident response investigations, build threat-informed defensive strategies, and
    prioritize detection engineering based on the tools most commonly used against their sector.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Malware Classification"
      value: >-
        Purpose-built malicious software documented with its full behavioral profile mapped
        to ATT&CK techniques, including capabilities for persistence, lateral movement,
        data collection, and command and control.
    - key: "Tool Classification"
      value: >-
        Legitimate or dual-use software (such as Mimikatz, PsExec, Cobalt Strike) that
        adversaries leverage during operations, mapped to the ATT&CK techniques each tool
        enables and the threat groups known to employ them.
    - key: "Software-Technique-Group Chains"
      value: >-
        Relationship mappings connecting specific software to the techniques it implements
        and the threat groups that use it, enabling multi-dimensional threat intelligence
        analysis and defensive prioritization.

    defenders to understand the full behavioral capabilities of encountered tools, scope
    incident response investigations, develop targeted detection rules, and track adversary
    capability evolution. When analysts encounter tools during incident response, the mapping
    provides immediate context about ATT&CK techniques the software can execute. Organizations
    use software-technique-group relationship chains for multi-dimensional threat intelligence
    analysis, detection engineering prioritization based on relevant adversary toolsets, and
    building threat-informed defensive strategies targeted at the specific software arsenal
    used by threat groups targeting their sector.
