definition:
  what: >
    A Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) is a formal organizational document that establishes
    the rules, scope, and procedures for external security researchers to report security
    vulnerabilities. It defines which systems and services are in scope for testing, what testing
    methods are authorized, the communication channels for submitting vulnerability reports
    (typically security@domain, security.txt, or web forms), expected response timelines,
    safe harbor commitments protecting researchers from legal action, and the organization's
    commitment to acknowledge, triage, and remediate reported vulnerabilities. VDPs are
    distinguished from bug bounty programs in that they do not necessarily offer financial
    rewards but provide a clear, legally safe channel for vulnerability reporting.
  why: >
    VDPs are increasingly mandated by law and regulation. CISA Binding Operational Directive 20-01
    requires all US federal agencies to maintain VDPs. The EU Cyber Resilience Act requires
    manufacturers to establish coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes. The NIS2 Directive
    mandates vulnerability handling policies for essential and important entities. Without a VDP,
    organizations lack a sanctioned channel for researchers to report findings, potentially
    leading to public disclosure without warning, legal disputes with well-intentioned researchers,
    or researchers selling vulnerabilities to malicious actors instead of reporting them.
  how: >
    Organizations create VDPs by defining the scope of authorized testing (in-scope systems,
    excluded systems, allowed testing methods), establishing reporting channels (security.txt
    per RFC 9116, dedicated email, web submission forms), committing to response timelines
    (acknowledgment within 3-5 business days, triage within 10 days, status updates at 30-day
    intervals), drafting safe harbor language with legal counsel, publishing the VDP on the
    organization's website, registering with CISA's VDP platform where applicable, training
    internal security teams on vulnerability triage and response, and establishing escalation
    procedures for critical vulnerabilities.

    - key: "Policy Scope"
      value: "Clear definition of which systems, services, and testing methods are authorized under the VDP"
    - key: "Safe Harbor Provisions"
      value: "Legal commitments protecting researchers who act in good faith and within policy scope from prosecution or civil action"
    - key: "Reporting Channels"
      value: "Designated communication methods for vulnerability submission including security.txt, email, web forms, and coordinated platforms"
    - key: "Response Commitments"
      value: "Defined timelines for acknowledging reports, triaging vulnerabilities, providing status updates, and remediating findings"
    - key: "Exclusions and Limitations"
      value: "Clearly defined out-of-scope systems, prohibited testing methods (DoS, social engineering, physical testing), and data handling requirements"

    A Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) is a formal organizational document establishing
    rules, scope, and procedures for external security researchers to report vulnerabilities.
    It defines in-scope systems, authorized testing methods, reporting channels (security.txt
    per RFC 9116, email, web forms), response timelines, and safe harbor protections for
    researchers. VDPs are mandated by CISA BOD 20-01 for US federal agencies, the EU Cyber
    Resilience Act for manufacturers, and the NIS2 Directive for essential entities. Unlike
    bug bounty programs, VDPs focus on providing a legally safe reporting channel rather than
    financial incentives. Key elements include scope definition, safe harbor language, response
    commitments, exclusions, and escalation procedures for critical findings.
