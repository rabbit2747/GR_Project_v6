definition:
  what: >
    License Compliance is the practice of ensuring that an organization's use of software,
    intellectual property, and digital assets conforms to the terms and conditions of applicable
    licenses. This encompasses commercial software licensing (per-seat, per-core, subscription,
    enterprise agreements), open source software (OSS) license obligations (GPL, LGPL, MIT,
    Apache, BSD), and SaaS subscription terms. Key concerns include license compatibility when
    combining software under different licenses, copyleft obligations requiring source code
    disclosure, attribution requirements, patent grant provisions, and restrictions on use,
    modification, and redistribution.
  why: >
    License non-compliance carries substantial legal and financial risks. Commercial software
    audit settlements can reach millions of dollars. Open source license violations can trigger
    copyright infringement claims, forced source code disclosure of proprietary software, and
    injunctive relief. The Software Alliance (BSA) actively pursues commercial license violations.
    In the open source domain, organizations like the Software Freedom Conservancy enforce GPL
    compliance. Beyond legal risk, license compliance is increasingly scrutinized in due diligence
    processes for mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs.
  how: >
    Organizations implement license compliance through Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools
    that inventory all software components and their licenses, maintaining a Software Bill of
    Materials (SBOM), establishing license approval policies that classify licenses as approved,
    restricted, or prohibited, training developers on license obligations, conducting regular
    license audits, implementing automated license checking in CI/CD pipelines, managing
    commercial software asset inventories, and establishing processes for responding to license
    compliance inquiries and audits from vendors and the open source community.

    License Compliance ensures organizational adherence to software license terms and conditions,
    covering commercial software agreements, open source license obligations, and SaaS subscription
    terms. Key areas include open source licenses (GPL, MIT, Apache, BSD), copyleft obligations
    requiring source code disclosure, license compatibility analysis, and commercial audit
    preparedness. Implementation involves Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools, Software
    Bill of Materials (SBOM) management, license approval policies, developer training, automated
    license checking in CI/CD pipelines, and regular audits. Non-compliance risks include
    copyright infringement claims, forced source code disclosure, financial penalties, and
    negative impact on M&A due diligence outcomes.
