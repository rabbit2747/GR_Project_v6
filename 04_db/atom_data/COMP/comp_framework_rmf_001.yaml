# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), defined in NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, is a structured
    process for integrating security, privacy, and supply chain risk management activities into
    the system development lifecycle of information systems. The RMF provides a seven-step
    process: Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, and Monitor. Originally
    developed for federal information systems under FISMA, the RMF is mandatory for all U.S.
    federal agencies and Department of Defense systems, and is increasingly adopted by private
    sector organizations as a comprehensive risk management methodology.
  why: >-
    Organizations need a disciplined, structured approach to managing cybersecurity risk that
    integrates security into the system development lifecycle rather than treating it as an
    afterthought. The RMF provides this structure by establishing a repeatable process for
    categorizing systems, selecting and implementing appropriate security controls, assessing
    control effectiveness, making risk-based authorization decisions, and continuously monitoring
    security posture. Without this framework, security decisions are ad hoc, controls may be
    inappropriate for actual risk levels, and authorization decisions lack documented rationale.
  how: >-
    The RMF follows seven steps: (1) Prepare - establish organizational context, define roles,
    and prepare for risk management activities; (2) Categorize - classify the information system
    and data based on impact levels (low, moderate, high) using FIPS 199; (3) Select - choose
    appropriate security controls from NIST SP 800-53 based on system categorization and
    organizational risk assessment; (4) Implement - deploy selected security controls and
    document implementation details; (5) Assess - evaluate whether controls are implemented
    correctly, operating as intended, and producing desired outcomes; (6) Authorize - senior
    officials make risk-based decisions to authorize system operation based on assessment
    results; (7) Monitor - continuously track changes, reassess controls, and report security
    status to maintain ongoing authorization.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Seven-Step Process"
      value: >-
        The structured lifecycle of Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize,
        and Monitor that provides a repeatable methodology for integrating security into
        system development and operations.
    - key: "System Categorization"
      value: >-
        Classification of information systems based on the potential impact of security
        breaches to confidentiality, integrity, and availability using FIPS 199 impact
        levels to determine appropriate security control baselines.
    - key: "Authorization to Operate (ATO)"
      value: >-
        A formal decision by a senior official to accept the risk associated with operating
        an information system based on documented assessment of security control effectiveness
        and residual risk.
    - key: "Continuous Monitoring"
      value: >-
        Ongoing assessment of security controls, system changes, and threat environment to
        maintain security authorization and ensure controls remain effective throughout
        the system lifecycle.

    The NIST Risk Management Framework defined in SP 800-37 Rev 2 is a structured seven-step
    process for integrating security, privacy, and supply chain risk management into information
    system development lifecycles. The steps are Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess,
    Authorize, and Monitor. Mandatory for U.S. federal agencies and DoD systems under FISMA,
    the RMF provides disciplined risk management by categorizing systems using FIPS 199 impact
    levels, selecting appropriate controls from SP 800-53, implementing and assessing those
    controls, making risk-based authorization decisions through Authorization to Operate, and
    continuously monitoring security posture. The framework ensures security is integrated
    throughout the system lifecycle rather than treated as an afterthought. Without the RMF,
    security decisions lack structure, controls may be inappropriate for actual risk levels,
    and authorization decisions lack documented rationale. The RMF is increasingly adopted by
    private sector organizations as a comprehensive risk management methodology.
