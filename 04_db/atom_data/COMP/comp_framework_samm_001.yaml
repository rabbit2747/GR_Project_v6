# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework for formulating and
    implementing a software security strategy tailored to the specific risks facing an organization.
    SAMM 2.0 organizes software security activities into five business functions: Governance,
    Design, Implementation, Verification, and Operations. Each business function contains three
    security practices, and each practice is assessed across three maturity levels, resulting in
    a comprehensive model of 15 security practices with 45 maturity level definitions. The model
    provides prescriptive activities, quality criteria, and maturity scoring to measure and improve
    an organization's software security posture over time.
  why: >-
    Organizations struggle to implement comprehensive software security programs because they lack
    a structured approach to assess their current maturity, prioritize improvements, and measure
    progress. Ad hoc security activities without a maturity framework lead to inconsistent
    coverage, wasted resources on low-impact activities, and inability to demonstrate security
    improvements to stakeholders. SAMM provides a measurable, prescriptive model that enables
    organizations to evaluate their existing software security practices, define a target maturity
    level, build a prioritized improvement roadmap, and track progress through objective scoring.
  how: >-
    SAMM implementation follows a structured lifecycle: (1) Assess current maturity by evaluating
    each of the 15 security practices against the three maturity levels using SAMM's assessment
    questionnaires and scoring criteria; (2) Set target maturity levels for each practice based
    on organizational risk tolerance, regulatory requirements, and business objectives;
    (3) Define improvement roadmaps by identifying specific activities needed to advance from
    current to target maturity levels; (4) Implement improvements through prioritized security
    activities within each business function; (5) Measure progress through periodic reassessment
    using the same scoring methodology. The five business functions cover: Governance (strategy,
    policy, education), Design (threat assessment, security requirements, security architecture),
    Implementation (secure build, secure deployment, defect management), Verification (architecture
    assessment, requirements-driven testing, security testing), and Operations (incident management,
    environment management, operational management).
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Five Business Functions"
      value: >-
        Software security activities organized into Governance, Design, Implementation,
        Verification, and Operations, covering the complete software development lifecycle
        from strategic planning through operational security management.
    - key: "Maturity Levels"
      value: >-
        Three progressive maturity levels for each security practice, from initial ad hoc
        activities (Level 1) through structured implementation (Level 2) to comprehensive
        optimization (Level 3), enabling measurable progress tracking.
    - key: "Prescriptive Activities"
      value: >-
        Specific, actionable security activities defined for each maturity level within
        each practice, providing clear implementation guidance rather than abstract
        recommendations, with quality criteria for objective assessment.

    OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework for formulating and

    contains three security practices assessed across three maturity levels, providing 15 practices
    with 45 maturity definitions. Organizations assess current maturity using questionnaires and
    scoring criteria, set target levels based on risk tolerance and regulatory requirements, build
    prioritized improvement roadmaps, implement security activities, and measure progress through
    periodic reassessment. The model addresses the challenge of implementing comprehensive software
    security programs by providing measurable, prescriptive activities with quality criteria.
    SAMM enables organizations to evaluate existing practices, define targets, and track
    improvement over time. The framework covers the complete software development lifecycle from
    strategic planning and threat assessment through secure build, testing, and operational
    security management.
