# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >
    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a United States federal law
    enacted in 1996 that establishes national standards for the protection of individually
    identifiable health information, known as Protected Health Information (PHI). HIPAA applies
    to covered entities (health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers conducting
    electronic transactions) and their business associates. The law comprises multiple rules: the
    Privacy Rule governing use and disclosure of PHI, the Security Rule mandating administrative,
    physical, and technical safeguards for electronic PHI (ePHI), the Breach Notification Rule
    requiring notification of unsecured PHI breaches, and the Enforcement Rule establishing
    investigation and penalty procedures.
  why: >
    HIPAA is the foundational US law for healthcare data protection, with enforcement by the HHS
    Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Violations can result in tiered civil monetary penalties ranging
    from $100 to $50,000 per violation (up to $1.5 million per year per violation category) and
    criminal penalties including fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment up to 10 years. Beyond
    penalties, HIPAA breaches damage patient trust, disrupt healthcare operations, and create
    litigation exposure. The HITECH Act of 2009 significantly strengthened HIPAA enforcement
    and extended obligations to business associates.
  how: >
    Organizations achieve HIPAA compliance by conducting risk analyses to identify threats to ePHI,
    implementing the Security Rule's administrative safeguards (security management process,
    workforce training, contingency planning), physical safeguards (facility access controls,
    workstation security, device controls), and technical safeguards (access controls, audit
    controls, integrity controls, transmission security). The Privacy Rule requires minimum
    necessary standards, patient rights management (access, amendment, accounting of disclosures),
    and Notice of Privacy Practices. Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) must be established with
    all third parties handling PHI.
