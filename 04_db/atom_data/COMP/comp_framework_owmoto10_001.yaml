# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The OWASP Mobile Top 10 is a standard awareness document identifying the ten most critical
    security risks to mobile applications on iOS and Android platforms. The 2024 edition covers:
    M1-Improper Credential Usage, M2-Inadequate Supply Chain Security, M3-Insecure Authentication
    and Authorization, M4-Insufficient Input/Output Validation, M5-Insecure Communication,
    M6-Inadequate Privacy Controls, M7-Insufficient Binary Protections, M8-Security
    Misconfiguration, M9-Insecure Data Storage, and M10-Insufficient Cryptography. Each risk
    category includes descriptions, threat agents, attack vectors, security weaknesses, and
    technical and business impact assessments specific to mobile platforms.
  why: >-
    Mobile applications present unique security challenges distinct from web applications
    including local data storage on untrusted devices, client-side binary distribution
    susceptible to reverse engineering, platform-specific security models, and intermittent
    connectivity requiring offline data handling. The Mobile Top 10 raises awareness of these
    mobile-specific risks among developers, security testers, and organizational leaders,
    ensuring that mobile application security receives appropriate attention alongside
    traditional web application security.
  how: >-
    The Mobile Top 10 is developed through data-driven analysis and expert consensus:
    (1) Vulnerability data is collected from mobile application security assessments worldwide;
    (2) Expert contributors review and categorize mobile-specific security risks;
    (3) Risk categories are ranked based on prevalence, exploitability, and impact;
    (4) Each category includes detailed descriptions, prevention guidelines, and example
    attack scenarios; (5) Organizations use the Mobile Top 10 for developer training, security
    requirements, penetration testing scope, and risk assessment of mobile applications.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Mobile-Specific Attack Surface"
      value: >-
        Security risks unique to mobile platforms including insecure local data storage,
        binary reverse engineering, inter-process communication vulnerabilities, and
        platform permission model weaknesses.
    - key: "Client-Side Security"
      value: >-
        Mobile applications run on devices controlled by users and potentially attackers,
        requiring binary protection, tamper detection, and the assumption that client-side
        controls can be bypassed.
    - key: "Privacy Controls"
      value: >-
        Mobile applications access sensitive device data including location, contacts,
        camera, and biometrics, requiring strict privacy controls and data minimization
        to comply with privacy regulations.

    The OWASP Mobile Top 10 identifies the ten most critical security risks to mobile
    applications on iOS and Android platforms. The 2024 edition covers improper credential
    usage, inadequate supply chain security, insecure authentication and authorization,
    insufficient input output validation, insecure communication, inadequate privacy controls,
    insufficient binary protections, security misconfiguration, insecure data storage, and
    insufficient cryptography. Mobile applications present unique security challenges including
    local data storage on untrusted devices, client-side binary reverse engineering,
    platform-specific security models, and offline data handling. The Mobile Top 10 raises
    awareness of mobile-specific risks among developers, testers, and organizational leaders.
    Each risk category includes descriptions, threat agents, attack vectors, and prevention
    guidelines. Organizations use it for developer training, security requirements, penetration
    testing scope, and mobile application risk assessment.
