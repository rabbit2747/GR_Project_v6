definition:
  what: "Security framework compliance is the operational practice of aligning an organization's security controls, processes, and governance structures with the requirements of one or more security frameworks. It encompasses the ongoing activities required to achieve, demonstrate, and maintain conformity with framework requirements including gap assessment, control implementation, evidence generation, assessment preparation, finding remediation, and continuous monitoring. Security framework compliance differs from the frameworks themselves in that it focuses on the operational execution of meeting framework requirements rather than the framework specifications."
  why: "Simply selecting a framework does not provide security assurance; the value comes from operationalizing compliance. Security framework compliance provides demonstrable evidence of due diligence, enables contractual and regulatory obligation fulfillment, reduces information asymmetry with customers and partners, and creates accountability structures that drive security improvement. Without active compliance management, frameworks become shelfware and organizations face regulatory penalties, contractual breaches, and increased breach risk."
  how: "Security framework compliance is achieved through a continuous lifecycle: assessing the current state against framework requirements, identifying and prioritizing gaps based on risk, implementing controls and processes to close gaps, generating and organizing evidence of compliance, preparing for and undergoing formal assessments, remediating any findings, and maintaining ongoing compliance through continuous monitoring and governance. Organizations typically use GRC platforms to manage evidence, track control status, coordinate assessments, and report compliance posture across multiple frameworks simultaneously."
