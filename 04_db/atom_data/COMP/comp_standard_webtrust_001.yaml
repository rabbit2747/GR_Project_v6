definition:
  what: "WebTrust is an assurance program developed jointly by the AICPA and CPA Canada that provides trust seals and audit standards for Certificate Authorities (CAs) and other online service providers. The WebTrust for Certification Authorities program is the primary audit standard that CAs must comply with to have their root certificates included in major browser and operating system trust stores (Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla, Google). WebTrust for CAs evaluates CA operations including certificate lifecycle management, key protection, subscriber verification, certificate revocation, and operational security against the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements and other applicable standards."
  why: "The entire web PKI trust model depends on Certificate Authorities operating securely and following established practices. A compromised or poorly operated CA can issue fraudulent certificates enabling man-in-the-middle attacks, phishing, and data interception across the internet. WebTrust for CAs provides the independent assurance that browser vendors require before including a CA's root certificate in their trust store. Without WebTrust compliance, a CA cannot effectively operate in the public PKI ecosystem, as their certificates would not be trusted by browsers and operating systems."
  how: "Certificate Authorities undergo annual WebTrust examinations conducted by licensed CPA firms. The examination evaluates CA controls against the WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities, which incorporate CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, Extended Validation guidelines, and code signing requirements. The auditor tests key management practices, certificate issuance procedures, identity verification processes, revocation handling, physical and logical security, and business continuity. Upon successful examination, the CA receives the WebTrust seal and maintains its position in browser trust stores. Browser vendors monitor WebTrust compliance and can remove CAs that fail to maintain their certification."
