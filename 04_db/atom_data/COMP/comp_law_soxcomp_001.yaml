  what: >
    SOX Compliance refers to adherence to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-204),
    a United States federal law mandating strict financial reporting and internal control
    requirements for publicly traded companies. Section 302 requires CEO and CFO certification
    of financial report accuracy and internal control effectiveness. Section 404 mandates
    management assessment and independent auditor attestation of internal controls over financial
    reporting (ICFR). Section 802 imposes criminal penalties for destruction, alteration, or
    falsification of financial records. SOX applies to all US publicly traded companies, their
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, and foreign companies listed on US exchanges, as well as their
    audit firms.
  why: >
    SOX was enacted in response to major corporate accounting scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Tyco)
    that destroyed billions in shareholder value and eroded public trust in capital markets.
    For IT and security teams, SOX has profound implications because financial reporting systems
    rely on IT infrastructure. Internal controls over financial reporting must extend to the
    IT systems that process, store, and transmit financial data. Non-compliance can result in
    personal criminal liability for executives (fines up to $5 million and imprisonment up to
    20 years), SEC enforcement actions, stock exchange delisting, and loss of investor confidence.
  how: >
    Organizations achieve SOX compliance by establishing and documenting internal controls over
    financial reporting, implementing IT General Controls (ITGCs) covering change management,
    access controls, computer operations, and program development for systems affecting financial
    reporting. Specific IT activities include implementing segregation of duties, maintaining
    access control lists for financial systems, deploying audit logging for all financial data
    modifications, establishing change management procedures for financial applications, performing
    regular access reviews, implementing backup and recovery for financial data, and engaging
    external auditors (PCAOB-registered) to attest to internal control effectiveness.
