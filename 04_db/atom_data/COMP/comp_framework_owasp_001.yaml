definition:
  what: >-
    The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that
    works to improve the security of software through community-led open-source projects,
    conferences, chapters, and educational resources. Founded in 2001, OWASP produces freely
    available tools, standards, and documentation focused on application security including
    the OWASP Top 10, Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), Testing Guide,
    Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM), Cheat Sheet Series, and numerous other projects.
    OWASP operates through volunteer-driven chapters in over 250 locations worldwide and
    maintains over 200 active open-source projects.
  why: >-
    Application-layer vulnerabilities remain the primary attack vector for data breaches, with
    web applications, APIs, and mobile applications representing the majority of the external
    attack surface for most organizations. OWASP addresses the critical need for freely
    available, vendor-neutral, and community-validated application security guidance. By
    providing standardized vulnerability taxonomies, verification standards, testing
    methodologies, and maturity models, OWASP enables organizations of all sizes to build
    and maintain secure software without requiring expensive proprietary resources.
  how: >-
    OWASP delivers its mission through several mechanisms: (1) Standards and guides - OWASP
    Top 10, ASVS, Testing Guide, SAMM, Mobile Top 10, and API Security Top 10 provide
    actionable security guidance; (2) Open-source tools - ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy), Dependency
    Check, DefectDojo, and others provide free security testing capabilities; (3) Cheat Sheet
    Series - concise, practical guidance on specific security topics for developers;
    (4) Community engagement - global conferences (Global AppSec), local chapter meetings,
    and open project collaboration; (5) Education - training materials, certification
    programs, and educational resources for developers, testers, and security professionals.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Community-Driven Standards"
      value: >-
        All OWASP resources are developed through open, community-driven processes with
        contributions from security professionals, developers, and researchers worldwide,
        ensuring broad expertise and real-world validation.
    - key: "Vendor-Neutral Guidance"
      value: >-
        OWASP resources are freely available and independent of any commercial vendor,
        providing unbiased security guidance that organizations can trust for objective
        application security recommendations.
    - key: "Application Security Focus"
      value: >-
        OWASP specifically targets the application layer of the technology stack, addressing
        web applications, APIs, mobile applications, and software development practices
        as the primary focus of all projects and guidance.
