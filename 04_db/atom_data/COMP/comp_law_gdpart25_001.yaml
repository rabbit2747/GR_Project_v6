definition:
  what: >
    GDPR Article 25 mandates that data controllers implement data protection by design and by
    default. This requires that appropriate technical and organizational measures be integrated
    into the design of processing operations from the outset, and that by default only personal
    data necessary for each specific purpose is processed. The article specifies that measures
    such as pseudonymization and data minimization shall be implemented, taking into account the
    state of the art, the cost of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes
    of processing, as well as the risks to data subjects.
  why: >
    Article 25 shifts the privacy paradigm from reactive remediation to proactive design. By
    requiring privacy controls to be embedded at the system architecture level, it ensures that
    data protection is not an afterthought but a fundamental design constraint. This reduces
    the risk of data breaches, limits unnecessary data exposure, and minimizes the attack surface
    for personal data. Violations can result in administrative fines up to 10 million EUR or 2%
    of global annual turnover.
  how: >
    Implementation involves conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) during system
    design, applying data minimization principles to limit collection and retention, implementing
    pseudonymization and anonymization where feasible, configuring default privacy settings to
    the most restrictive level, applying purpose limitation controls, building access controls
    that enforce need-to-know principles, and documenting design decisions that demonstrate
    compliance with Article 25 requirements.

    GDPR Article 25 establishes the legal requirement for data protection by design and by default.
    It mandates that data controllers implement appropriate technical and organizational measures
    such as pseudonymization and data minimization at the time of system design and throughout
    processing operations. By default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose
    should be processed, limiting collection scope, storage duration, and accessibility. The
    article considers the state of the art, implementation costs, and risks to data subjects.
    Implementation involves DPIAs, privacy-centric architecture decisions, restrictive default
    settings, and access controls enforcing need-to-know principles.
