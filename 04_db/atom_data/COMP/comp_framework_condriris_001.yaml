# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Consequence Driven Risk Assessment, formally known as Consequence-driven Cyber-informed
    Engineering (CCE), is a methodology developed by Idaho National Laboratory (INL) that
    prioritizes cybersecurity efforts based on the potential consequences of successful
    cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. Unlike traditional risk assessment
    approaches that focus on threat likelihood and vulnerability enumeration, CCE begins
    with identifying the highest-consequence events that an adversary could achieve and
    works backward to determine the cyber-physical attack paths that could produce those
    consequences. The methodology was developed under the direction of the U.S. Department
    of Energy to protect industrial control systems and operational technology environments.
  why: >-
    Traditional cybersecurity risk assessments often produce overwhelming lists of
    vulnerabilities without adequate prioritization based on actual impact to the organization
    or national security. Critical infrastructure operators face resource constraints that
    prevent addressing all vulnerabilities simultaneously. CCE addresses this by focusing
    defensive resources on preventing the specific high-consequence events that matter most,
    such as loss of safety systems, environmental damage, or disruption of essential services.
    This consequence-first approach ensures that the most impactful risks are mitigated first,
    regardless of perceived likelihood.
  how: >-
    CCE follows a four-phase methodology: (1) Consequence Prioritization - identify and rank
    the highest-consequence events that could result from cyberattack, including safety
    incidents, environmental releases, and operational disruption; (2) System-of-Systems
    Analysis - map the digital infrastructure supporting critical functions, identifying
    all cyber-connected pathways to high-consequence targets; (3) Consequence-Based Targeting -
    analyze how a sophisticated adversary would exploit identified pathways to achieve
    high-consequence outcomes, developing detailed attack scenarios; (4) Mitigations and
    Protections - implement engineering-based mitigations that eliminate or reduce the
    possibility of high-consequence outcomes, prioritizing controls that provide physical
    protection against cyber-enabled attacks.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Consequence-First Prioritization"
      value: >-
        Beginning risk assessment by identifying the worst possible outcomes rather than
        starting from vulnerability enumeration, ensuring defensive resources are focused
        on the highest-impact scenarios regardless of perceived likelihood.
    - key: "Cyber-Physical Attack Path Analysis"
      value: >-
        Systematic mapping of digital pathways that connect IT networks to operational
        technology and physical processes, identifying how cyber intrusions could produce
        physical-world consequences.
    - key: "Engineering-Based Mitigations"
      value: >-
        Controls that use physical engineering principles to prevent cyber-enabled
        consequences, such as analog safety systems, physical interlocks, and hardwired
        controls that cannot be defeated through cyber means alone.
    - key: "Adversary-Informed Analysis"
      value: >-
        Assessment approach that assumes a sophisticated, well-resourced adversary with
        knowledge of target systems, ensuring mitigations are effective against advanced
        persistent threats rather than only opportunistic attackers.
