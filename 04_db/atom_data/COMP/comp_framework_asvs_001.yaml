# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is a framework of security
    requirements and controls for designing, developing, and testing secure web applications
    and APIs. Version 4.0 contains 286 security verification requirements organized into 14
    chapters covering architecture, authentication, session management, access control,
    validation, cryptography, error handling, data protection, communications, malicious code,
    business logic, files and resources, API, and configuration. ASVS defines three verification
    levels: Level 1 (low assurance for all applications), Level 2 (standard for applications
    containing sensitive data), and Level 3 (highest assurance for critical applications).
  why: >-
    The OWASP Top 10 identifies common vulnerability categories but does not provide the
    comprehensive, testable security requirements needed for secure application design and
    verification. ASVS fills this gap by providing a detailed checklist of security controls
    that can be used as requirements during development, verification criteria during testing,
    and assessment standards during procurement. The three-tiered approach enables organizations
    to apply proportional security based on application criticality and data sensitivity.
  how: >-
    ASVS is implemented across three levels: (1) Level 1 - automated verification achievable
    through penetration testing, covering the most critical security requirements including
    authentication, session management, and access control basics; (2) Level 2 - recommended
    for most applications, requiring manual verification of defense in depth controls including
    input validation, cryptographic protections, and security logging; (3) Level 3 - required
    for the most critical applications handling sensitive data, requiring comprehensive
    verification of all 286 requirements including architectural security patterns, advanced
    cryptographic controls, and business logic protections. Organizations use ASVS as
    security requirements during SDLC, acceptance criteria during testing, and evaluation
    criteria during vendor assessment.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Three Verification Levels"
      value: >-
        Graduated assurance levels where Level 1 provides basic security verification,
        Level 2 provides standard assurance for sensitive applications, and Level 3 provides
        maximum assurance for critical applications requiring defense in depth.
    - key: "286 Security Requirements"
      value: >-
        Comprehensive, testable security requirements organized into 14 chapters covering
        all application security domains from architecture through API security.
    - key: "Requirements-Based Approach"
      value: >-
        ASVS provides prescriptive, verifiable security requirements rather than descriptive
        guidance, enabling use as development requirements, testing criteria, and procurement
        standards.

    OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is a framework of security
    requirements for designing, developing, and testing secure web applications and APIs.
    Version 4.0 contains 286 security verification requirements in 14 chapters covering
    architecture, authentication, session management, access control, validation, cryptography,
    and more. Three verification levels provide graduated assurance: Level 1 for basic security
    achievable through automated testing, Level 2 for standard applications with sensitive data,
    and Level 3 for critical applications requiring maximum assurance. ASVS provides prescriptive,
    verifiable security requirements rather than descriptive guidance, enabling use as development
    requirements during SDLC, acceptance criteria during testing, and evaluation criteria during
    procurement. The standard extends beyond OWASP Top 10 coverage to provide comprehensive
    application security requirements that organizations apply proportionally based on
    application criticality and data sensitivity.
