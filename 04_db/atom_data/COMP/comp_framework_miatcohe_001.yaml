# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The MITRE ATT&CK Coverage Heatmap is a visual representation of an organization's detection
    and prevention capabilities mapped against the MITRE ATT&CK framework matrix. Created using
    the ATT&CK Navigator tool, heatmaps display color-coded overlays on the ATT&CK technique
    matrix indicating the level of coverage (none, partial, full) that security controls and
    detection rules provide for each technique and sub-technique. Organizations generate heatmaps
    by mapping their SIEM detection rules, EDR capabilities, network monitoring, and security
    control inventory to specific ATT&CK technique IDs, producing a gap analysis that reveals
    which adversary techniques remain undetected or unmitigated.
  why: >-
    Security operations centers often deploy detection rules and security controls without a
    systematic understanding of which adversary techniques they can detect or prevent. This
    results in blind spots where advanced adversaries can operate undetected. Coverage heatmaps
    provide an objective, evidence-based view of defensive posture against the full spectrum of
    known adversary behaviors. They enable security teams to prioritize detection engineering
    efforts toward the highest-risk gaps, justify security investments with quantifiable coverage
    metrics, and track defensive improvement over time against a standardized framework.
  how: >-
    Implementation involves: (1) Inventorying all existing security controls, detection rules,
    and monitoring capabilities across SIEM, EDR, NDR, and other security platforms;
    (2) Mapping each control or detection rule to the specific ATT&CK technique(s) it addresses
    using technique IDs; (3) Using the ATT&CK Navigator to create layer files that visually
    represent coverage levels with color gradients; (4) Overlaying threat intelligence about
    adversary groups targeting the organization's sector to prioritize gaps against relevant
    threats; (5) Identifying coverage gaps and developing detection engineering roadmaps to
    address high-priority techniques; (6) Regularly updating heatmaps as new detections are
    deployed and the ATT&CK framework is updated with new techniques.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "ATT&CK Navigator"
      value: >-
        An open-source web application maintained by MITRE that provides an interactive
        interface for creating, annotating, and visualizing ATT&CK matrix layers including
        detection coverage, threat group overlays, and gap analysis views.
    - key: "Detection Coverage Scoring"
      value: >-
        A quantitative assessment methodology that rates the depth and quality of detection
        for each ATT&CK technique, typically using a scale from no coverage through partial
        detection to full prevention and response capability.
    - key: "Threat-Informed Gap Analysis"
      value: >-
        The practice of overlaying threat intelligence about adversary groups known to target
        the organization's sector onto coverage heatmaps to prioritize detection engineering
        against the most relevant and likely attack techniques.
    - key: "Detection Engineering Roadmap"
      value: >-
        A prioritized plan for developing new detection rules and deploying additional security
        controls to close gaps identified through coverage heatmap analysis, aligned with
        organizational risk appetite and threat landscape.
