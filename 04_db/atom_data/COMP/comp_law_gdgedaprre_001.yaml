# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >
    The GDPR General Data Protection Regulation is the complete regulatory framework encompassing
    all 99 articles across 11 chapters and 173 recitals of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. This atom
    represents the full legislative text as a unified legal instrument, covering: general provisions
    and definitions (Chapter I), principles of processing (Chapter II), rights of data subjects
    (Chapter III), obligations of controllers and processors (Chapter IV), international data
    transfers (Chapter V), independent supervisory authorities (Chapter VI), cooperation and
    consistency mechanisms (Chapter VII), remedies, liability, and penalties (Chapter VIII),
    specific processing situations (Chapter IX), delegated and implementing acts (Chapter X),
    and final provisions (Chapter XI).
  why: >
    Understanding the GDPR as a complete legal framework rather than individual articles is essential
    for building comprehensive compliance programs. The regulation's chapters are interdependent,
    with principles in Chapter II informing the interpretation of specific articles, and enforcement
    provisions in Chapter VIII providing the incentive structure. Organizations must address the
    regulation holistically to avoid gaps that arise from piecemeal implementation. The GDPR has
    served as the model for data protection laws adopted globally, making it the de facto international
    standard for personal data protection.
  how: >
    Organizations operationalize the full GDPR by establishing data governance frameworks that
    address every chapter: defining processing principles and lawful bases, implementing data subject
    rights workflows, appointing DPOs, conducting DPIAs, maintaining ROPAs, implementing technical
    and organizational security measures, establishing cross-border transfer mechanisms, cooperating
    with supervisory authorities, and building breach response procedures. Compliance requires
    cross-functional coordination between legal, IT, security, HR, and business teams, supported
    by continuous monitoring, regular audits, and training programs.

    The GDPR General Data Protection Regulation encompasses the complete legal text of Regulation
    (EU) 2016/679, comprising 99 articles in 11 chapters and 173 recitals. It is the comprehensive
    EU framework for personal data protection, covering processing principles, data subject rights,
    controller and processor obligations, international data transfers, supervisory authority
    powers, enforcement mechanisms, and penalties. The regulation applies extraterritorially to
    any organization processing personal data of EU residents. It mandates accountability through
    DPO appointments, DPIAs, ROPAs, breach notification, and technical security measures. The
    GDPR has become the global benchmark for data protection legislation, with fines reaching
    20 million EUR or 4% of global annual turnover.
