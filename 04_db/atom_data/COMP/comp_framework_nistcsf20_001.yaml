# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    NIST CSF 2.0, released in February 2024, is the major update to the NIST Cybersecurity
    Framework that expands scope from critical infrastructure to all organizations regardless
    of sector or size. The most significant change is the addition of a sixth core function,
    Govern, alongside the original five (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). CSF 2.0
    introduces improved organizational profiles, tiered implementation levels, an expanded
    catalog of informative references mapped to other frameworks, and enhanced supply chain
    risk management guidance. The framework is now explicitly designed for international
    adoption with improved integration points for global cybersecurity standards.
  why: >-
    The original CSF 1.1 was designed primarily for critical infrastructure and lacked explicit
    governance guidance. As cybersecurity became a board-level concern and regulatory requirements
    expanded globally, organizations needed a framework that addressed governance, supply chain
    risk, and organizational cybersecurity culture. CSF 2.0 addresses these gaps by adding the
    Govern function to emphasize cybersecurity as an enterprise risk alongside financial,
    reputational, and operational risks, and by broadening applicability beyond critical
    infrastructure to all organizations.
  how: >-
    CSF 2.0 is structured around six core functions: (1) Govern - establish and monitor
    cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy including organizational
    context, risk management strategy, roles and responsibilities, policy, oversight, and
    supply chain risk management; (2) Identify - understand organizational cybersecurity risk
    through asset management, risk assessment, and improvement planning; (3) Protect - implement
    safeguards including identity management, awareness training, data security, platform
    security, and technology infrastructure resilience; (4) Detect - identify cybersecurity
    events through continuous monitoring and adverse event analysis; (5) Respond - take action
    regarding detected incidents through incident management, analysis, reporting, and
    mitigation; (6) Recover - restore capabilities through incident recovery plan execution
    and recovery communication.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Govern Function"
      value: >-
        The new sixth core function in CSF 2.0 that establishes cybersecurity risk management
        strategy, organizational context, policies, roles, oversight, and supply chain risk
        management as foundational governance activities.
    - key: "Organizational Profiles"
      value: >-
        Customized descriptions of an organization's current and target cybersecurity posture
        using CSF functions, categories, and subcategories, enabling gap analysis and
        improvement planning.
    - key: "Implementation Tiers"
      value: >-
        Four tiers (Partial, Risk Informed, Repeatable, Adaptive) describing the degree of
        rigor and sophistication in cybersecurity risk management practices, from informal
        and ad hoc to agile and risk-informed.
    - key: "Expanded Scope"
      value: >-
        CSF 2.0 is explicitly designed for all organizations regardless of sector, size, or
        cybersecurity maturity, expanding from the original critical infrastructure focus to
        universal applicability.
