# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture) published in August 2020 defines zero trust as
    an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based
    perimeters to a focus on users, assets, and resources. The publication provides an abstract
    definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA), deployment models, and use cases for
    implementing zero trust principles in enterprise environments. It defines the logical
    components including Policy Engine, Policy Administrator, and Policy Enforcement Point
    that form the core ZTA architecture. Executive Order 14028 mandated that federal agencies
    implement zero trust architecture as defined in this publication.
  why: >-
    Traditional perimeter-based network security assumes that internal network traffic is
    trustworthy, an assumption invalidated by modern threats, cloud adoption, remote workforces,
    and the dissolution of network boundaries. SP 800-207 addresses this by defining a security
    model that eliminates implicit trust, requiring verification for every access request
    regardless of source network location. The publication provides the authoritative reference
    architecture that federal agencies and private organizations use to plan and implement
    zero trust transformations.
  how: >-
    SP 800-207 defines ZTA through logical components: (1) Policy Engine (PE) - the brain
    that grants, denies, or revokes access based on enterprise policy and input from external
    sources; (2) Policy Administrator (PA) - establishes and shuts down communication paths
    based on PE decisions; (3) Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) - enables, monitors, and terminates
    connections between subjects and enterprise resources. The publication describes three
    deployment approaches: enhanced identity governance, micro-segmentation, and software-defined
    perimeters. Implementation requires continuous diagnostics and mitigation, identity
    governance, network segmentation, threat intelligence feeds, and security analytics for
    real-time policy decisions.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Zero Trust Tenets"
      value: >-
        Core principles including all data sources and computing services are resources,
        all communication is secured regardless of network location, access is granted on
        a per-session basis, access is determined by dynamic policy, and the enterprise
        monitors all assets.
    - key: "Policy Decision and Enforcement Architecture"
      value: >-
        The PE/PA/PEP architecture where the Policy Engine makes access decisions, the
        Policy Administrator manages communication paths, and the Policy Enforcement Point
        enforces decisions at the access boundary.
    - key: "Deployment Models"
      value: >-
        Three approaches for implementing ZTA: enhanced identity governance using identity
        as the primary security boundary, micro-segmentation placing resources on individual
        network segments, and software-defined perimeters using overlay networks.

    reference architecture for zero trust transformations addressing the obsolescence of
    perimeter-based security assumptions.
