# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations,
    providing a structured approach to active defense and adversary denial, deception, and
    engagement. Evolved from the earlier MITRE Shield project, Engage organizes adversary
    engagement activities into strategic goals (Expose, Affect, Elicit) and operational
    approaches including Collect, Contain, Detect, Direct, Disrupt, Motivate, and Reassure.
    The framework provides a vocabulary and methodology for organizations to plan adversary
    engagement operations that go beyond passive defense, including honeypots, deception
    environments, and controlled adversary interaction.
  why: >-
    Traditional defensive security is entirely reactive, focused on preventing and detecting
    attacks. Organizations that limit themselves to passive defense cede the initiative to
    adversaries who control the timing, location, and method of attack. Engage provides a
    framework for defenders to take the initiative through controlled adversary interaction,
    enabling intelligence collection about adversary tradecraft, increasing adversary cost
    and uncertainty, protecting critical assets through misdirection, and validating defensive
    assumptions through observed adversary behavior. This active defense approach shifts the
    asymmetry of effort toward defenders.
  how: >-
    Implementation follows three strategic goals: (1) Expose - collect intelligence about
    adversary behavior and capabilities through monitored engagement environments, honeypots,
    and deception technologies; (2) Affect - negatively impact adversary operations through
    containment, disruption, and misdirection activities that increase cost and reduce
    effectiveness; (3) Elicit - drive adversary behavior toward specific actions through
    environmental manipulation and directed exposure. Operational approaches include deploying
    deception environments, implementing honeypots and honeytokens, creating breadcrumbs that
    lead adversaries to monitored systems, operating engagement environments that simulate
    production assets, and coordinating engagement activities with threat intelligence teams
    for maximum intelligence value.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Adversary Engagement Operations"
      value: >-
        Planned and deliberate interactions with adversaries designed to collect intelligence,
        increase adversary cost, and protect critical assets through deception and controlled
        interaction rather than simple prevention.
    - key: "Strategic Goals: Expose, Affect, Elicit"
      value: >-
        Three high-level objectives that guide engagement planning: exposing adversary
        capabilities through observation, affecting adversary operations through disruption,
        and eliciting specific adversary behaviors through environmental manipulation.
    - key: "Deception Operations"
      value: >-
        Deployment of fake assets, credentials, data, and environments designed to mislead
        adversaries, detect unauthorized access, and gather intelligence about adversary
        objectives and tradecraft.
    - key: "Active Defense"
      value: >-
        A defensive strategy that goes beyond passive prevention and detection to include
        deliberate engagement with adversaries, shifting from purely reactive to proactive
        defense posture.

    MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations
    that provides a structured approach to active defense including adversary denial, deception,
    and controlled engagement. Evolved from MITRE Shield, Engage organizes activities into
    three strategic goals: Expose (collect adversary intelligence), Affect (disrupt adversary
    operations), and Elicit (drive adversary behavior). Operational approaches include Collect,
    Contain, Detect, Direct, Disrupt, Motivate, and Reassure. The framework enables organizations
    to move beyond passive defense by deploying deception environments, honeypots, honeytokens,
    and controlled engagement scenarios that collect intelligence about adversary tradecraft,
    increase adversary cost and uncertainty, and protect critical assets through misdirection.
    Engage shifts the defender-attacker asymmetry by providing structured methodology for
    deliberate adversary interaction. It requires ATT&CK adversary behavior knowledge for
    effective engagement planning and complements D3FEND defensive techniques with strategic
    active defense operations.
