# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    NIST SP 800-53 (Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations)
    is the comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls used to protect federal
    information systems and organizations. Revision 5, published in September 2020, contains
    over 1,000 controls organized into 20 control families. The catalog provides the security
    control baselines (Low, Moderate, High) used in the NIST Risk Management Framework and
    serves as the authoritative source for security requirements referenced by the NIST
    Cybersecurity Framework, FedRAMP, CMMC, and numerous other compliance programs. SP 800-53
    is the most comprehensive and widely referenced security controls catalog globally.
  why: >-
    Organizations need a comprehensive, organized catalog of security controls to select
    from when designing and implementing information security programs. SP 800-53 provides
    this by cataloging controls across all security domains with sufficient detail for
    implementation, assessment, and audit. The three baselines (Low, Moderate, High) enable
    proportional security based on system impact levels determined through FIPS 199
    categorization. Without such a catalog, organizations would need to independently develop
    security requirements, leading to inconsistent coverage and gaps.
  how: >-
    SP 800-53 Rev. 5 organizes controls into 20 families: Access Control (AC), Awareness and
    Training (AT), Audit and Accountability (AU), Assessment Authorization and Monitoring (CA),
    Configuration Management (CM), Contingency Planning (CP), Identification and Authentication
    (IA), Incident Response (IR), Maintenance (MA), Media Protection (MP), Physical and
    Environmental Protection (PE), Planning (PL), Program Management (PM), Personnel Security
    (PS), PII Processing and Transparency (PT), Risk Assessment (RA), System and Services
    Acquisition (SA), System and Communications Protection (SC), System and Information
    Integrity (SI), and Supply Chain Risk Management (SR). Organizations use the RMF to
    select controls from appropriate baselines and tailor them to specific system requirements.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "20 Control Families"
      value: >-
        Comprehensive organization of over 1,000 security and privacy controls into 20
        domain-specific families covering access control, audit, configuration management,
        incident response, and all other security disciplines.
    - key: "Control Baselines"
      value: >-
        Three predefined sets of controls (Low, Moderate, High) tailored to system impact
        levels, providing proportional security starting points that organizations further
        customize based on specific risk assessments.
    - key: "Control Enhancements"
      value: >-
        Additional functionality added to base controls to provide increased protection
        capability, enabling organizations to strengthen controls in areas of higher risk
        or sensitivity.
    - key: "Privacy Controls Integration"
      value: >-
        Rev. 5 integrates privacy controls alongside security controls, recognizing the
        convergence of security and privacy requirements and adding the PII Processing
        and Transparency family.

    families covering access control, audit, configuration management, incident response,

    security based on FIPS 199 system impact levels. The catalog is the authoritative source
    referenced by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, RMF, FedRAMP, CMMC, and numerous compliance
    programs globally. Rev 5 integrates privacy controls alongside security controls with
    the new PII Processing and Transparency family. Control enhancements provide increased
    protection capability for higher-risk areas. SP 800-53 is the most comprehensive security
    controls catalog globally, enabling organizations to select, implement, and assess
    controls proportional to their risk through the Risk Management Framework methodology.
