definition:
  what: "PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a global security standard developed by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) that defines requirements for organizations that store, process, or transmit payment card data. The standard consists of 12 high-level requirements organized into 6 goals: build and maintain a secure network, protect cardholder data, maintain a vulnerability management program, implement strong access control measures, regularly monitor and test networks, and maintain an information security policy. PCI DSS applies to all entities in the payment card ecosystem including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and service providers."
  why: "Payment card data breaches expose millions of cardholders to financial fraud and identity theft. PCI DSS establishes a minimum security baseline for the payment card industry, reducing the risk of data compromise through mandatory security controls. Compliance is contractually required by the major card brands (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB) and failure to comply can result in significant fines, increased transaction fees, and loss of the ability to process card payments."
  how: "Organizations determine their compliance validation level based on annual transaction volume and card brand requirements. Compliance is validated through either a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for smaller merchants or a Report on Compliance (ROC) prepared by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) for larger entities. The assessment evaluates the cardholder data environment (CDE), including network segmentation, encryption of stored and transmitted data, access controls, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, logging and monitoring, and security policies. Quarterly network vulnerability scans by an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) are also required."
