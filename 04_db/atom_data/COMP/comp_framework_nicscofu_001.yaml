# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The NIST CSF Core Functions are the six high-level cybersecurity outcome categories that
    organize the NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Govern (GV), Identify (ID), Protect (PR),
    Detect (DE), Respond (RS), and Recover (RC). Each function is divided into categories
    and subcategories that describe specific cybersecurity outcomes. As of CSF 2.0, the
    framework contains 6 functions, 22 categories, and 106 subcategories. The functions
    are not intended as serial steps but as concurrent and continuous activities that
    collectively address an organization's cybersecurity risk management lifecycle.
  why: >-
    Organizations need a high-level organizing principle to ensure their cybersecurity programs
    are comprehensive and balanced across all aspects of risk management. The core functions
    provide this structure by ensuring that governance, asset identification, protective
    controls, detection capabilities, incident response, and recovery planning all receive
    appropriate attention. Without this structured approach, organizations tend to
    over-invest in protective controls while under-investing in detection, response, and
    recovery capabilities, creating blind spots and slow recovery from inevitable breaches.
  how: >-
    The six core functions are implemented as follows: (1) Govern (GV) - establish cybersecurity
    governance including organizational context, risk strategy, roles and responsibilities,
    policies, oversight, and supply chain risk management; (2) Identify (ID) - develop
    understanding of cybersecurity risk through asset management, risk assessment, and
    improvement planning; (3) Protect (PR) - implement safeguards through identity management,
    awareness training, data security, platform security, and technology resilience;
    (4) Detect (DE) - discover cybersecurity events through continuous monitoring and adverse
    event analysis; (5) Respond (RS) - take action on detected events through incident
    management, analysis, reporting, and mitigation; (6) Recover (RC) - restore normal
    operations through recovery plan execution and communication.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Govern (GV)"
      value: >-
        Establishes organizational cybersecurity risk management strategy, policies, roles,
        oversight, and supply chain governance as the foundational function that informs all
        other cybersecurity activities.
    - key: "Identify (ID)"
      value: >-
        Develops understanding of organizational assets, business environment, governance,
        risk assessment, and risk management strategy to prioritize cybersecurity efforts
        based on risk context.
    - key: "Protect (PR)"
      value: >-
        Implements safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services including identity
        management, access control, awareness training, data security, and protective
        technology deployment.
    - key: "Detect (DE)"
      value: >-
        Discovers cybersecurity events in a timely manner through continuous monitoring,
        anomaly detection, and security event analysis across organizational systems.
    - key: "Respond (RS)"
      value: >-
        Takes action regarding detected cybersecurity incidents through response planning,
        communications, analysis, mitigation, and improvements to prevent recurrence.
    - key: "Recover (RC)"
      value: >-
        Restores capabilities and services impaired by cybersecurity incidents through
        recovery planning, improvements, and communications to stakeholders.

    The NIST CSF Core Functions are six high-level cybersecurity outcome categories organizing
    the NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
    CSF 2.0 contains 6 functions, 22 categories, and 106 subcategories. Govern establishes
    cybersecurity risk management strategy, policies, and oversight. Identify develops
    understanding of organizational assets and risk context. Protect implements safeguards
    including identity management, data security, and access control. Detect discovers
    cybersecurity events through continuous monitoring. Respond takes action on detected
    incidents through management, analysis, and mitigation. Recover restores capabilities
    through recovery planning and communication. The functions operate concurrently and
    continuously rather than as serial steps, ensuring comprehensive and balanced cybersecurity
    programs that address governance, identification, protection, detection, response, and
    recovery equally rather than over-investing in protection while under-investing in
    detection and recovery capabilities.
