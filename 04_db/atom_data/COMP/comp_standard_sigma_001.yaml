definition:
  what: "Sigma is an open, generic, and vendor-agnostic signature format for describing log events and detection rules used in security monitoring and threat detection. Sigma rules are written in YAML format and define detection logic that can be converted into queries for various SIEM platforms including Splunk, Elastic, Microsoft Sentinel, QRadar, and others through converters (sigmac/pySigma). The Sigma rule repository maintained by the community contains thousands of detection rules covering MITRE ATT&CK techniques, malware behaviors, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and other security-relevant events across Windows, Linux, and cloud environments."
  why: "Security teams face a fragmented detection landscape where each SIEM platform uses a proprietary query language, making detection rules non-portable and creating vendor lock-in. Sigma addresses this by providing a universal detection rule format that enables sharing of detection logic across organizations and platforms, reduces duplication of detection engineering effort, and establishes a community-driven library of high-quality detection rules. Sigma has become a de facto standard for the security community to share and operationalize threat detection knowledge."
  how: "Security teams author Sigma rules by defining log source specifications, detection conditions using boolean logic and field mappings, and metadata including MITRE ATT&CK mappings, severity levels, and false positive guidance. Rules are stored in YAML format and converted to platform-specific queries using pySigma converters (backends) for their target SIEM. Organizations integrate Sigma into their detection pipeline by establishing a rule management workflow, converting community and custom rules to their SIEM platform, testing rules against sample data, tuning for false positives, and maintaining rule sets through version control and automated deployment."
