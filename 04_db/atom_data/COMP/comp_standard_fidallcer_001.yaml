definition:
  what: "FIDO Alliance Certification is a formal certification program operated by the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance that validates the interoperability, security, and conformance of authentication products against FIDO specifications including FIDO2/WebAuthn, FIDO UAF (Universal Authentication Framework), and FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd Factor). Certified products have been tested by accredited laboratories to verify they correctly implement FIDO protocols, meet security requirements for cryptographic operations and authenticator security, and interoperate with other certified components in the FIDO ecosystem."
  why: "Password-based authentication is the primary attack vector for credential theft, phishing, and account takeover. FIDO certification ensures that passwordless and multi-factor authentication products implement strong public-key cryptography correctly, resist phishing attacks through origin-bound credentials, and interoperate across vendors. Certification provides relying parties with assurance that authenticators meet defined security levels and function correctly within the FIDO ecosystem."
  how: "Vendors submit their products (authenticators, servers, or clients) to FIDO-accredited testing laboratories for functional conformance testing and interoperability testing. Products are tested against the relevant FIDO specification to verify correct protocol implementation, cryptographic operations, and authenticator security characteristics. Security levels (L1 through L3+) define increasing hardware and software protection requirements. Upon passing, products are listed in the FIDO Certified Products directory and may display the FIDO Certified mark."
