definition:
  what: >
    Compliance is the broad discipline of ensuring that an organization adheres to applicable laws,
    regulations, industry standards, and internal policies governing its operations, data handling,
    and security practices. It encompasses the systematic identification of legal obligations,
    implementation of controls to satisfy those obligations, continuous monitoring for adherence,
    and remediation of gaps. Compliance programs span multiple regulatory domains including data
    privacy (GDPR, CCPA), financial reporting (SOX), healthcare (HIPAA), payment card handling
    (PCI DSS), and sector-specific requirements.
  why: >
    Non-compliance exposes organizations to significant legal penalties, financial losses, reputational
    damage, and operational disruption. Regulatory fines can reach billions of dollars under frameworks
    such as GDPR. A mature compliance posture also strengthens security by mandating baseline controls,
    audit trails, and accountability structures that reduce the likelihood and impact of breaches.
  how: >
    Organizations establish compliance programs by mapping applicable regulations to their operations,
    performing gap analyses against required controls, implementing technical and administrative
    safeguards, conducting regular internal and external audits, training personnel on obligations,
    and maintaining evidence of adherence through documentation, logs, and reports. GRC (Governance,
    Risk, and Compliance) platforms are often used to automate tracking and reporting.

    Compliance is the overarching discipline of ensuring organizational adherence to applicable
    laws, regulations, industry standards, and internal policies. It covers data privacy regulations
    such as GDPR and CCPA, financial reporting mandates like SOX, healthcare rules including HIPAA,
    and payment standards like PCI DSS. A compliance program involves regulatory mapping, gap
    analysis, control implementation, continuous monitoring, auditing, training, and remediation.
    Non-compliance risks include financial penalties, legal liability, reputational harm, and
    operational disruption. Organizations typically use GRC platforms to automate compliance
    tracking, evidence collection, and reporting across multiple regulatory domains.
