definition:
  what: "The Control Correlation Identifier (CCI) catalog is a standardized reference maintained by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) that provides a unique identifier for each actionable statement derived from NIST SP 800-53 security controls. CCIs decompose high-level controls into granular, single-action security requirements that can be directly assessed. The CCI catalog serves as the bridge between policy-level controls in NIST SP 800-53 and the technical implementation checks in Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) and Security Requirements Guides (SRGs)."
  why: "Security controls as written in frameworks like NIST SP 800-53 are often too broad for direct technical assessment. The CCI catalog solves this by breaking each control into discrete, testable requirements. This enables automated compliance checking, consistent assessment across different systems and platforms, and traceable mapping from policy requirements to technical configurations. It is essential for DoD and federal compliance programs."
  how: "Each CCI maps a single actionable statement from a NIST SP 800-53 control to one or more technical implementation checks in STIGs. Organizations use the CCI catalog to trace compliance from high-level policy through control objectives to specific technical configurations. Automated STIG compliance scanners reference CCIs to report findings, enabling aggregation of technical results back to control-level compliance status. The CCI catalog is distributed as an XML dataset by DISA and integrated into compliance assessment tools."

  embedding_text: "The Control Correlation Identifier (CCI) catalog is a DISA-maintained reference that decomposes NIST SP 800-53 security controls into granular, individually assessable requirements. Each CCI provides a unique identifier for a single actionable security statement, bridging the gap between policy-level controls and technical implementation checks in STIGs and SRGs. The CCI catalog enables automated compliance checking, consistent assessment across platforms, and traceable mapping from regulatory requirements to specific technical configurations. It is essential for DoD and federal compliance programs using NIST-based security frameworks."
