definition:
  what: >-
    A Cloud Governance Framework is a structured set of policies, controls, and processes that
    organizations use to manage risk, ensure compliance, and maintain security across cloud
    computing environments. The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is
    the most widely adopted cloud governance framework, providing 197 control objectives across
    17 domains aligned with major compliance standards including ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53,
    PCI DSS, and GDPR. Cloud governance encompasses identity and access management, data
    protection, configuration management, incident response, and continuous compliance
    monitoring across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS deployment models.
  why: >-
    Cloud adoption introduces shared responsibility models where security accountability is
    divided between the cloud service provider and the customer. Without a governance framework,
    organizations face misconfigurations (the leading cause of cloud breaches per Gartner),
    compliance gaps across multi-cloud environments, shadow IT proliferation, uncontrolled
    cost escalation, and data sovereignty violations. Cloud governance frameworks provide
    the structure to ensure that security controls are consistently applied, compliance
    obligations are met, and risk is managed across heterogeneous cloud environments.
  how: >-
    Implementation involves: (1) Adopting a control framework such as CSA CCM or CIS Benchmarks
    as the baseline for cloud security requirements; (2) Mapping shared responsibility boundaries
    between the organization and each cloud provider; (3) Implementing cloud security posture
    management (CSPM) tools for continuous configuration monitoring and drift detection;
    (4) Establishing identity federation and centralized access governance across cloud
    accounts; (5) Deploying cloud access security brokers (CASB) for visibility and policy
    enforcement; (6) Implementing data classification and protection controls including
    encryption, DLP, and data residency enforcement; (7) Automating compliance reporting
    and audit evidence collection through cloud-native and third-party tools.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Shared Responsibility Model"
      value: >-
        The security accountability framework where cloud providers are responsible for
        security of the cloud infrastructure, while customers are responsible for security
        in the cloud including data, identity, and application configuration.
    - key: "Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)"
      value: >-
        Automated tools that continuously monitor cloud configurations against security
        baselines, detect misconfigurations, and enforce compliance policies across
        multi-cloud environments.
    - key: "Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)"
      value: >-
        The CSA Cloud Controls Matrix providing 197 control objectives across 17 domains
        that serve as a meta-framework for cloud security governance, mapped to major
        compliance standards and regulations.
    - key: "Multi-Cloud Governance"
      value: >-
        Policies and controls that provide consistent security and compliance management
        across multiple cloud service providers, addressing the complexity of heterogeneous
        cloud environments.

    Cloud Governance Framework is a structured set of policies, controls, and processes for
    managing risk, compliance, and security across cloud computing environments. The Cloud
    Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix is the most widely adopted framework, providing
    197 control objectives across 17 domains mapped to ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS,
    and GDPR. Cloud governance addresses the shared responsibility model where security
    accountability is divided between cloud providers and customers. Key components include
    cloud security posture management for continuous configuration monitoring, identity
    federation for centralized access governance, cloud access security brokers for visibility
    and policy enforcement, and data classification with encryption and DLP controls.
    Implementation requires mapping shared responsibility boundaries, deploying CSPM tools,
    establishing multi-cloud governance policies, and automating compliance reporting.
    Without governance, organizations face misconfiguration vulnerabilities, compliance gaps,
    shadow IT, and data sovereignty violations across heterogeneous cloud environments.
