# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The OWASP Top 10 is the most widely recognized awareness document for web application
    security, identifying the ten most critical security risks to web applications. The 2021
    edition includes: A01-Broken Access Control, A02-Cryptographic Failures, A03-Injection,
    A04-Insecure Design, A05-Security Misconfiguration, A06-Vulnerable and Outdated Components,
    A07-Identification and Authentication Failures, A08-Software and Data Integrity Failures,
    A09-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures, and A10-Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    Each risk category includes description, common vulnerabilities, attack scenarios, and
    prevention guidance. The Top 10 is updated approximately every three to four years based
    on industry-wide vulnerability data analysis.
  why: >-
    Web application vulnerabilities remain the primary vector for data breaches and
    cyber attacks against organizations. Developers, security testers, and organizational
    leaders need a prioritized, accessible reference for the most impactful web security
    risks to guide development practices, security testing, and risk management. The OWASP
    Top 10 provides this by distilling thousands of vulnerability data points into ten
    actionable risk categories, establishing a common vocabulary for application security
    across the industry and serving as the minimum security awareness standard that
    regulatory frameworks, security assessments, and procurement processes reference.
  how: >-
    The OWASP Top 10 is developed through a data-driven process: (1) Vulnerability data
    is collected from application security companies, bug bounty programs, and security
    assessments covering hundreds of thousands of applications worldwide; (2) Data is
    analyzed for incidence rates, exploitability, detectability, and technical impact;
    (3) Risk categories are ranked using a combination of quantitative data analysis and
    qualitative expert input; (4) Each category includes a standardized description with
    Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) mappings, example attack scenarios, and prevention
    guidelines; (5) Organizations use the Top 10 for developer security training, as
    minimum requirements for security testing programs, as baseline security requirements
    in software procurement, and as a starting point for more comprehensive standards
    like ASVS. The Top 10 explicitly states it is an awareness document and should not
    be used as the sole security standard.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Data-Driven Risk Ranking"
      value: >-
        Risk categories ranked through analysis of real-world vulnerability data from
        hundreds of thousands of applications, combining quantitative incidence rates
        with expert assessment of exploitability and impact to identify the most critical
        web application security risks.
    - key: "Awareness Document"
      value: >-
        The Top 10 serves as an awareness and education tool providing a prioritized
        starting point for web application security, explicitly designed to be
        supplemented by more comprehensive standards like ASVS for detailed security
        requirements.
    - key: "Industry Common Vocabulary"
      value: >-
        Establishes standardized risk categories with CWE mappings that create a shared
        language for application security across development teams, security professionals,
        auditors, and regulatory frameworks worldwide.
