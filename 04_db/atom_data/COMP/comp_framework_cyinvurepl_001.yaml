# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks are standardized operational
    procedures published by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in
    November 2021, mandated by Executive Order 14028. The playbooks provide federal civilian
    executive branch (FCEB) agencies with a structured approach for planning and conducting
    cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities. The Incident Response Playbook
    covers preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and
    post-incident activities. The Vulnerability Response Playbook standardizes vulnerability
    identification, evaluation, remediation, and reporting processes aligned with NIST SP 800-61
    and Binding Operational Directives.
  why: >-
    Prior to these playbooks, federal agencies lacked a unified standard for incident and
    vulnerability response, leading to inconsistent response quality, delayed containment,
    poor information sharing, and difficulty coordinating across agencies during significant
    cyber incidents. The SolarWinds supply chain compromise and other major incidents
    demonstrated the need for standardized, repeatable response procedures. These playbooks
    ensure that all FCEB agencies follow consistent processes, share information through
    standardized channels, and meet response timeline requirements established by Binding
    Operational Directives.
  how: >-
    Implementation follows two primary playbook tracks: (1) Incident Response - establish
    incident response teams, implement detection and monitoring capabilities, define severity
    classification criteria, execute containment procedures based on incident type, perform
    forensic evidence preservation, conduct eradication and system recovery, and execute
    post-incident review and lessons learned; (2) Vulnerability Response - integrate with
    CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, implement vulnerability scanning
    and prioritization using CVSS and SSVC frameworks, define remediation timelines per
    BOD 22-01, track remediation progress, and report status through CyberScope and CDM
    dashboards. Both playbooks require integration with CISA reporting requirements and
    coordination through the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC).
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Standardized Incident Response Lifecycle"
      value: >-
        A five-phase response process covering preparation, detection and analysis,
        containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity, aligned with
        NIST SP 800-61 to ensure consistent handling across all federal agencies.
    - key: "Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog"
      value: >-
        CISA-maintained catalog of vulnerabilities known to be actively exploited in the
        wild, requiring mandatory remediation by FCEB agencies within specified timelines
        under BOD 22-01.
    - key: "Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC)"
      value: >-
        A decision-tree-based vulnerability prioritization framework developed by CISA
        and Carnegie Mellon that considers exploitation status, automatable exposure,
        and mission impact to guide remediation priority.
    - key: "Cross-Agency Coordination"
      value: >-
        Standardized information sharing and coordination protocols ensuring that incident
        response activities are communicated to CISA, sector-specific agencies, and affected
        parties through established channels and timelines.

    The Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks are standardized operational
    procedures published by CISA in November 2021 under Executive Order 14028. They provide
    federal civilian executive branch agencies with structured approaches for cybersecurity
    incident and vulnerability response. The Incident Response Playbook covers preparation,
    detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activities
    aligned with NIST SP 800-61. The Vulnerability Response Playbook standardizes vulnerability
    identification, evaluation, and remediation processes integrated with the CISA Known
    Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog and Binding Operational Directive 22-01 timelines.
    Implementation requires incident response teams, detection monitoring, severity classification,
    forensic evidence preservation, and cross-agency coordination through the Joint Cyber
    Defense Collaborative. Vulnerability response integrates CVSS and SSVC prioritization
    frameworks for risk-based remediation scheduling. These playbooks address the inconsistent
    response quality demonstrated during major incidents like SolarWinds by establishing
    unified federal response standards.
