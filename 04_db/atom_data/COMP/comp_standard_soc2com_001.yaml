definition:
  what: "The SOC 2 Compliance Framework is the operational program that service organizations establish to achieve, maintain, and continuously improve their SOC 2 compliance posture. It encompasses the governance structure, control design and implementation methodology, evidence collection and management processes, audit preparation procedures, gap remediation workflows, and continuous monitoring capabilities needed to sustain SOC 2 certification. The framework addresses trust service criteria selection, control mapping to criteria points, evidence automation, audit liaison processes, and the annual examination cycle."
  why: "Achieving an initial SOC 2 report requires significant investment in control design and implementation, but the ongoing challenge is maintaining compliance between annual examinations while adapting to business changes. A structured compliance framework ensures controls remain effective as systems evolve, new services are deployed, and personnel change. It reduces the annual audit preparation burden, minimizes the risk of qualified opinions or exceptions, and enables the organization to leverage SOC 2 as a competitive advantage with enterprise customers."
  how: "Organizations implement the SOC 2 compliance framework by establishing a compliance team with defined responsibilities, selecting applicable trust service criteria and mapping controls, implementing automated evidence collection through integration with cloud platforms and security tools, establishing continuous monitoring for control effectiveness, maintaining a control matrix documenting each control, its owner, evidence sources, and testing procedures, conducting readiness assessments before the formal examination, coordinating with the CPA firm during the audit period, remediating any identified control gaps, and iterating annually to improve the control environment."
