  what: >
    GDPR Data Transfer Mechanisms are the legally recognized instruments under GDPR Chapter V
    (Articles 44-49) that permit the transfer of personal data from the EU/EEA to third countries
    or international organizations. The primary mechanisms include adequacy decisions by the
    European Commission (Article 45), Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as adopted by the
    Commission (Article 46(2)(c)), Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) for intra-group transfers
    (Article 47), codes of conduct and certification mechanisms (Article 46(2)(e-f)), and
    derogations for specific situations such as explicit consent or contract necessity (Article 49).
    Following the Schrems II ruling (2020), supplementary measures may be required to ensure
    adequate protection in the recipient country.
  why: >
    International data transfers are fundamental to global business operations, cloud computing,
    and modern IT architectures. Without a valid transfer mechanism, any transfer of personal data
    outside the EU/EEA is unlawful under GDPR, exposing organizations to fines of up to 20 million
    EUR or 4% of global annual turnover. The invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield by the Schrems
    II ruling and the subsequent adoption of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework demonstrate the evolving
    nature of cross-border data transfer compliance.
  how: >
    Organizations implement lawful data transfers by first mapping all data flows involving personal
    data leaving the EU/EEA, then selecting an appropriate transfer mechanism for each flow. For
    transfers to countries with adequacy decisions, no additional safeguards are needed. For transfers
    relying on SCCs, organizations must conduct Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) to evaluate
    whether the recipient country provides essentially equivalent protection, and implement
    supplementary technical measures (encryption, pseudonymization, access controls) where gaps
    are identified. BCRs require approval from supervisory authorities and establish group-wide
    data protection policies.

    ruling that invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield, organizations must conduct Transfer Impact
    Assessments and implement supplementary technical measures such as encryption and
    pseudonymization. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework adopted in 2023 provides a new adequacy
    basis for US transfers. Non-compliance with transfer requirements carries GDPR penalties
    of up to 20 million EUR or 4% of global annual turnover.
