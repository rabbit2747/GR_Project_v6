definition:
  what: "PCI PIN Security Requirements is a PCI SSC standard that defines the security requirements for the management, processing, and transmission of personal identification number (PIN) data during online and offline payment card transactions. The standard specifies requirements for PIN processing, PIN encryption at the point of entry, secure PIN transmission across payment networks, PIN block format and encryption algorithms, key management for PIN encryption keys, and physical and logical security of devices and systems that process PIN data. It applies to all entities involved in PIN-based debit and credit card transactions."
  why: "PIN data is the most sensitive cardholder verification method, providing direct access to debit account funds. Compromise of PIN data combined with card data enables immediate financial fraud through ATM withdrawals and unauthorized purchases. The PIN Security standard ensures that PIN data is encrypted from the point of entry and remains protected throughout the transaction lifecycle, preventing interception, replay, and brute-force attacks against PIN values."
  how: "Organizations comply with PCI PIN Security by implementing hardware security modules (HSMs) for PIN encryption and translation operations, using approved PIN block formats (ISO 9564), establishing secure key management procedures including dual control and split knowledge for PIN encryption keys, implementing tamper-resistant PIN entry devices, maintaining physical security of PIN processing environments, and undergoing assessment by PIN Security Assessors. Key management includes key generation in secure environments, distribution through encrypted channels, and key rotation procedures."
