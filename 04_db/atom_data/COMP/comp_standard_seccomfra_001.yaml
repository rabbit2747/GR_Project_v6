definition:
  what: "Security compliance frameworks are structured sets of guidelines, standards, and best practices that organizations use to manage information security risks and demonstrate compliance with regulatory, industry, and contractual requirements. Major frameworks include NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and FedRAMP. Each framework defines control objectives, implementation requirements, assessment methodologies, and reporting structures. Frameworks may be prescriptive (specifying exact controls) or risk-based (allowing organizations to select controls based on their risk profile)."
  why: "Organizations face a complex landscape of overlapping regulatory, industry, and contractual security requirements. Security compliance frameworks provide structured approaches to systematically address these requirements, reduce duplication of effort through control mapping across frameworks, demonstrate security posture to stakeholders through standardized reporting, and establish a common language for discussing security controls and risk management across the organization and with external parties."
  how: "Organizations adopt security compliance frameworks by identifying applicable requirements based on their industry, geography, and business relationships. They then map controls across multiple frameworks to identify commonalities and reduce duplication, implement controls using a risk-based approach, establish continuous monitoring and evidence collection processes, undergo formal assessments or audits as required by each framework, and maintain ongoing compliance through governance processes. GRC platforms automate much of this work by providing cross-framework control mapping, evidence management, and compliance reporting."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Control Mapping"
      value: "Aligning controls across multiple frameworks to identify overlap and ensure comprehensive coverage with minimal duplication"
    - key: "Risk-Based Approach"
      value: "Selecting and implementing controls based on organizational risk assessment rather than prescriptive checklists"
    - key: "Compliance Assessment"
      value: "Formal evaluation of control implementation and effectiveness against framework requirements by internal or external assessors"
    - key: "Framework Harmonization"
      value: "Coordinating compliance activities across multiple frameworks to reduce assessment fatigue and redundant controls"
