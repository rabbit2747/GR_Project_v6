# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >
    Industry Compliance refers to the body of regulatory requirements, standards, and legal
    obligations specific to particular business sectors. Different industries face distinct
    regulatory landscapes: healthcare is governed by HIPAA, financial services by SOX, GLBA,
    and Basel III, payment card processing by PCI DSS, telecommunications by FCC regulations,
    energy by NERC CIP, government contractors by FedRAMP and FISMA, and critical infrastructure
    by sector-specific CISA directives. Industry compliance extends beyond general data protection
    laws to encompass sector-specific operational, reporting, licensing, and security requirements
    that reflect the unique risk profiles and public interest concerns of each industry.
  why: >
    Industry-specific regulations exist because different sectors handle different types of
    sensitive data and pose different risks to public welfare. A healthcare organization faces
    different threat models than a financial institution or energy provider. Failure to meet
    industry-specific compliance requirements results in sector-specific enforcement actions,
    license revocations, exclusion from government programs, and loss of industry certifications
    that may be prerequisites for doing business. The penalties and enforcement mechanisms vary
    significantly across industries.
  how: >
    Organizations address industry compliance by first identifying their regulatory classification
    and applicable sector-specific requirements, then mapping those requirements to existing
    controls and identifying gaps. Implementation involves deploying industry-specific security
    frameworks (e.g., NIST for government, HITRUST for healthcare), obtaining required certifications
    and attestations, engaging industry-specific auditors, participating in industry Information
    Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), and maintaining ongoing compliance with evolving
    sector-specific regulations through dedicated compliance teams and regulatory monitoring.

    Industry Compliance encompasses the regulatory requirements, standards, and legal obligations
    specific to particular business sectors. Healthcare organizations face HIPAA, financial
    services operate under SOX, GLBA, and Basel III, payment processors must comply with PCI DSS,
    energy companies follow NERC CIP, and government contractors require FedRAMP and FISMA.
    Each sector has unique enforcement agencies, certification requirements, and compliance
    frameworks reflecting its risk profile. Organizations must identify their sector classification,
    map applicable requirements, deploy industry-specific frameworks like HITRUST or FedRAMP,
    obtain required certifications, and participate in industry ISACs. Cross-industry overlap
    means many organizations face simultaneous multi-sector compliance obligations.
