definition:
  what: "Digital safety certification encompasses formal programs and processes through which organizations, products, or services are evaluated and certified as meeting established cybersecurity and digital safety standards. These certifications are issued by accredited bodies after rigorous assessment of security controls, risk management practices, and operational procedures. Examples include Common Criteria (ISO 15408), Cyber Essentials, CSA STAR, and various national cybersecurity certification schemes. Certification programs define evaluation criteria, assessment methodologies, and ongoing maintenance requirements."
  why: "Digital safety certifications provide third-party assurance that products and organizations meet minimum security standards. They reduce information asymmetry between vendors and customers, enable risk-based procurement decisions, satisfy regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions, and demonstrate due diligence in cybersecurity practices. Certifications serve as a trust signal in the digital economy, particularly for critical infrastructure and government procurement."
  how: "The certification process typically involves: defining the scope and applicable criteria, conducting a self-assessment or gap analysis, implementing required security controls, engaging an accredited assessment body, undergoing formal evaluation against the certification criteria, remediating any findings, receiving the certification, and maintaining compliance through periodic reassessment. Certifications may be product-specific, organization-wide, or service-specific depending on the scheme."

  embedding_text: "Digital safety certification encompasses formal programs where organizations, products, or services are evaluated against established cybersecurity standards by accredited bodies. Certifications like Common Criteria, Cyber Essentials, and CSA STAR provide third-party assurance of security control effectiveness. The certification process involves scope definition, gap analysis, control implementation, formal evaluation by accredited assessors, finding remediation, and ongoing maintenance through periodic reassessment. Certifications reduce information asymmetry between vendors and customers, satisfy regulatory requirements, and demonstrate cybersecurity due diligence in procurement and compliance contexts."
