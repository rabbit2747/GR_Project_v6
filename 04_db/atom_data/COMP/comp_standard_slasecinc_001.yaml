definition:
  what: "SLA for Security Incidents defines the contractual and operational service level agreements governing the detection, response, containment, and resolution of security incidents. These SLAs establish measurable time-bound commitments for each phase of incident response, typically organized by incident severity level. Critical incidents may require detection within 15 minutes, initial response within 1 hour, containment within 4 hours, and resolution within 24 hours. SLAs also define notification requirements, escalation procedures, communication cadences, and post-incident review timelines. They apply to internal security teams, managed security service providers (MSSPs), and cloud service provider security operations."
  why: "Without defined SLAs, security incident response times are unpredictable and inconsistent, leading to extended dwell times, larger breach impact, and regulatory non-compliance. Security SLAs create accountability for response times, enable measurement of security operations effectiveness, satisfy regulatory notification requirements (GDPR 72-hour, HIPAA 60-day), and establish clear expectations between organizations and their security service providers. SLAs also drive investment in detection and response capabilities to meet committed timelines."
  how: "Organizations establish security incident SLAs by defining severity classification criteria, mapping response time commitments to each severity level, establishing escalation procedures and communication protocols, implementing monitoring and alerting systems capable of meeting detection SLAs, staffing security operations to meet response time commitments, deploying incident management platforms for tracking and measuring SLA adherence, conducting regular exercises to validate response capabilities, and reporting SLA metrics to stakeholders through security dashboards and governance reviews."
