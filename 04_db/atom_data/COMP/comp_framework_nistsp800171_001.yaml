# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    NIST SP 800-171 (Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and
    Organizations) defines the security requirements for protecting Controlled Unclassified
    Information (CUI) when it resides in nonfederal systems and organizations. The current
    revision (Rev. 3, May 2024) contains 110 security requirements organized into 17 families
    derived from NIST SP 800-53 moderate baseline controls. SP 800-171 is the foundation for
    the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program and is required for all
    Department of Defense contractors handling CUI through DFARS clause 252.204-7012.
  why: >-
    Federal agencies share sensitive but unclassified information with contractors, state and
    local governments, and other nonfederal entities. This Controlled Unclassified Information
    requires consistent protection regardless of where it resides. SP 800-171 establishes the
    minimum security requirements that nonfederal organizations must implement to protect CUI,
    ensuring that sensitive government information maintains adequate confidentiality protections
    throughout the supply chain. The defense industrial base alone includes over 300,000
    contractors subject to these requirements.
  how: >-
    SP 800-171 Rev. 3 security requirements are organized into 17 families: Access Control,
    Awareness and Training, Audit and Accountability, Configuration Management, Identification
    and Authentication, Incident Response, Maintenance, Media Protection, Personnel Security,
    Physical Protection, Risk Assessment, Security Assessment, System and Communications
    Protection, System and Information Integrity, Planning, System and Services Acquisition,
    and Supply Chain Risk Management. Organizations implement by: (1) Identifying CUI within
    their systems; (2) Assessing current implementation against all 110 requirements;
    (3) Developing a System Security Plan (SSP) documenting implementations; (4) Creating a
    Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) for gaps; (5) Implementing controls and conducting
    self-assessments or third-party assessments per CMMC requirements.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)"
      value: >-
        Government-created or government-possessed information that requires safeguarding
        or dissemination controls consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and
        government-wide policies, but is not classified national security information.
    - key: "110 Security Requirements"
      value: >-
        The specific security controls derived from NIST SP 800-53 moderate baseline that
        nonfederal organizations must implement to protect CUI, organized into 17 families.
    - key: "CMMC Integration"
      value: >-
        SP 800-171 requirements form the foundation of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model
        Certification program, which requires third-party assessment of defense contractor
        compliance for handling CUI.
    - key: "System Security Plan (SSP)"
      value: >-
        Documentation describing how each SP 800-171 requirement is implemented within the
        organization's information systems, serving as the primary compliance artifact.

    families cover access control, audit, configuration management, identification and
    authentication, incident response, and other security domains. Organizations implement
    by identifying CUI, assessing against requirements, developing System Security Plans and
    Plans of Action and Milestones, and conducting self-assessments or third-party assessments.
    The defense industrial base includes over 300,000 contractors subject to these requirements,
    ensuring consistent CUI protection throughout the government supply chain regardless of
    where sensitive information resides.
