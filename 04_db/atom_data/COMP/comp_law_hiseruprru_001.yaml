definition:
  what: >
    The HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR 164, Subpart C) and Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164, Subpart E) are
    two distinct but complementary regulatory frameworks within HIPAA. The Privacy Rule governs
    the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) in all forms (oral, written,
    electronic) and establishes patient rights over their health data. The Security Rule specifically
    addresses the protection of electronic PHI (ePHI) and mandates three categories of safeguards:
    administrative (risk analysis, workforce training, contingency planning), physical (facility
    access, workstation security, device controls), and technical (access controls, audit controls,
    integrity controls, transmission security). While the Privacy Rule defines what information
    must be protected and under what conditions it may be shared, the Security Rule specifies how
    electronic health information must be technically secured.
  why: >
    Understanding the distinction between these two rules is critical because they impose different
    obligations, apply to different forms of data, and require different compliance activities.
    The Security Rule is technology-focused and requires IT controls, while the Privacy Rule is
    policy-focused and addresses organizational data handling practices. Many HIPAA violations
    result from confusion between the two rules, such as implementing strong technical controls
    (Security Rule) while failing to properly restrict disclosures (Privacy Rule) or vice versa.
    Both rules must be addressed together for complete HIPAA compliance.
  how: >
    Organizations address both rules by implementing parallel compliance programs. For the Privacy
    Rule: designating a Privacy Officer, developing Notice of Privacy Practices, establishing
    policies for minimum necessary use, managing patient rights requests (access, amendment,
    accounting of disclosures), and training workforce on permitted uses and disclosures. For
    the Security Rule: designating a Security Officer, conducting ePHI risk analyses, implementing
    required and addressable safeguard specifications, deploying encryption and access controls,
    establishing audit logging and monitoring, developing contingency and disaster recovery plans,
    and conducting periodic security evaluations.

    The HIPAA Security Rule and Privacy Rule are distinct but complementary regulatory frameworks.
    The Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164 Subpart E) governs the use and disclosure of all Protected Health
    Information in any form and establishes patient rights. The Security Rule (45 CFR 164 Subpart C)
    specifically addresses electronic PHI and mandates three categories of safeguards: administrative
    (risk analysis, workforce training, contingency planning), physical (facility access, device
    controls), and technical (access controls, audit controls, encryption, transmission security).
    Security Rule specifications are classified as either required or addressable. Both rules must
    be addressed together for complete HIPAA compliance, with separate Privacy Officer and Security
    Officer designations typically required.
