# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series is a collection of over 80 concise, practical security
    guidance documents designed to provide developers and security professionals with quick-
    reference information on specific application security topics. Each cheat sheet covers a
    single security domain with actionable implementation guidance, code examples, and common
    pitfall warnings. Topics include authentication, authorization, input validation, SQL
    injection prevention, cross-site scripting prevention, cryptographic storage, session
    management, REST security, GraphQL security, Docker security, Kubernetes security, and
    many other development-specific security concerns.
  why: >-
    Developers need accessible, concise security guidance that can be consumed quickly during
    the development process. Comprehensive security standards like ASVS and full testing guides
    are essential but too detailed for quick reference during coding. The Cheat Sheet Series
    bridges this gap by providing focused, actionable guidance that developers can reference
    when implementing specific security-sensitive features, enabling secure coding practices
    without requiring deep security expertise.
  how: >-
    Each cheat sheet follows a consistent format: (1) Introduction explaining the security
    topic and its importance; (2) Specific implementation guidance with language-agnostic
    and framework-specific recommendations; (3) Code examples demonstrating secure implementation
    patterns; (4) Common mistakes and anti-patterns to avoid; (5) References to related OWASP
    resources and external standards. The series is maintained on GitHub with community
    contributions and is available as a free website. New cheat sheets are added as new
    security topics emerge, and existing sheets are updated to reflect current best practices.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Developer-Focused Security Guidance"
      value: >-
        Practical, code-level security guidance written specifically for developers who are
        implementing security-sensitive features, providing actionable recommendations rather
        than abstract security principles.
    - key: "Quick-Reference Format"
      value: >-
        Concise, focused documents covering single security topics that can be consumed
        quickly during development, bridging the gap between comprehensive standards and
        day-to-day coding practices.
    - key: "Community-Maintained Currency"
      value: >-
        Open-source maintenance through GitHub ensuring cheat sheets remain current with
        evolving threats, new frameworks, and updated best practices through community
        contributions.
