# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    NIST SP 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide) provides guidelines for incident
    handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate
    response to each incident. Revision 2, published in August 2012, defines the incident
    response lifecycle consisting of four phases: Preparation; Detection and Analysis;
    Containment, Eradication, and Recovery; and Post-Incident Activity. The guide covers
    incident handling for common attack vectors including external media, attrition, web,
    email, impersonation, improper usage, loss or theft, and other vectors. It is the
    authoritative reference for federal incident response programs.
  why: >-
    Computer security incidents are inevitable and organizations must be prepared to respond
    effectively. Without structured incident handling procedures, organizations face delayed
    detection, inconsistent response quality, inadequate evidence preservation, extended
    recovery times, and failure to learn from incidents. SP 800-61 provides the standardized
    methodology that ensures incidents are detected promptly, contained effectively, eradicated
    thoroughly, and that post-incident analysis drives continuous improvement of security
    controls and response capabilities.
  how: >-
    SP 800-61 defines a four-phase incident response lifecycle: (1) Preparation - establishing
    incident response capability including team formation, tools acquisition, communication
    procedures, and exercise programs; (2) Detection and Analysis - identifying incidents
    through precursors and indicators, analyzing events, documenting findings, prioritizing
    incidents by functional impact, information impact, and recoverability; (3) Containment,
    Eradication, and Recovery - selecting containment strategies, collecting evidence,
    identifying and eliminating the attack vector, and restoring systems to normal operation;
    (4) Post-Incident Activity - conducting lessons learned meetings, using collected data
    to improve security controls, retaining evidence per policy, and measuring incident
    response effectiveness metrics.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Four-Phase Incident Response Lifecycle"
      value: >-
        The structured process of Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment Eradication
        and Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity that provides a repeatable methodology for
        handling security incidents from initial detection through final resolution.
    - key: "Incident Prioritization"
      value: >-
        Classification of incidents based on functional impact, information impact, and
        recoverability to ensure resources are allocated appropriately and the most critical
        incidents receive immediate attention.
    - key: "Evidence Preservation"
      value: >-
        Procedures for collecting, handling, and preserving digital evidence during incident
        response to support forensic analysis, legal proceedings, and post-incident review.
    - key: "Lessons Learned"
      value: >-
        Post-incident analysis process that identifies what happened, how it was handled,
        what could be improved, and what changes should be made to prevent similar incidents.

    NIST SP 800-61 Computer Security Incident Handling Guide provides guidelines for incident
    handling and response. The four-phase lifecycle covers Preparation establishing response
    capability, Detection and Analysis identifying and prioritizing incidents, Containment
    Eradication and Recovery eliminating threats and restoring systems, and Post-Incident
    Activity conducting lessons learned. The guide covers incident handling for common attack
    vectors including web, email, impersonation, and improper usage. Incidents are prioritized
    by functional impact, information impact, and recoverability. The publication addresses
    evidence preservation for forensic analysis and legal proceedings. SP 800-61 is the
    authoritative reference for federal incident response programs, implementing NIST SP 800-53
    Incident Response controls and the NIST CSF Detect and Respond functions. Without structured
    incident handling, organizations face delayed detection, inconsistent response, inadequate
    evidence preservation, and failure to learn from incidents for continuous improvement.
