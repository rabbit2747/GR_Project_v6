# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The NIST SP 800-53 1200 Controls refers to the full inventory of approximately 1,200
    individual security and privacy controls and control enhancements contained in NIST SP
    800-53 Revision 5. This includes the base controls within each of the 20 control families
    plus their associated control enhancements that add specificity and strength. The count
    includes roughly 325 base controls and approximately 900 control enhancements that provide
    graduated levels of protection. This comprehensive catalog represents the most granular
    level of the NIST security control framework, enabling precise selection and tailoring
    of security requirements for any information system or organizational context.
  why: >-
    The full control catalog provides the granularity necessary for organizations to build
    precise security programs tailored to their specific risk profiles. While control baselines
    provide starting points, organizations often need to select individual controls and
    enhancements based on specific threats, regulatory requirements, or business contexts.
    The breadth of the catalog ensures that virtually every security domain and attack vector
    has corresponding controls, eliminating the need for organizations to develop custom
    requirements from scratch. The enhancement structure enables graduated protection levels
    that scale with system criticality and risk.
  how: >-
    The 1200 controls are organized across 20 families with each family containing base
    controls and progressive enhancements: (1) Each base control describes a security
    capability requirement; (2) Control enhancements add specificity, strength, or scope
    to the base control; (3) Organizations select controls through the RMF process starting
    with baselines (Low: ~130 controls, Moderate: ~325 controls, High: ~421 controls) and
    adding or removing controls through tailoring; (4) SP 800-53A provides assessment
    procedures for each control; (5) SP 800-53B defines the baseline allocations;
    (6) Organizations document control implementations in System Security Plans and assess
    effectiveness through formal assessment procedures.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Base Controls and Enhancements"
      value: >-
        The two-tier structure where base controls define required security capabilities and
        numbered enhancements add graduated levels of specificity and strength, enabling
        proportional security implementation.
    - key: "Control Tailoring"
      value: >-
        The process of modifying baseline control selections by adding controls for specific
        threats, removing controls not applicable to the environment, and adjusting control
        parameters to match organizational requirements.
    - key: "Baseline Allocation"
      value: >-
        The assignment of specific controls and enhancements to Low, Moderate, and High
        impact baselines as defined in SP 800-53B, providing proportional starting points
        based on system categorization.

    NIST SP 800-53 1200 Controls refers to the full inventory of approximately 1,200 individual
    security and privacy controls and enhancements in SP 800-53 Revision 5. This includes
    roughly 325 base controls and 900 control enhancements across 20 families providing
    graduated protection levels. The catalog is the most granular level of NIST security
    controls, enabling precise selection and tailoring for any system context. Control baselines
    provide starting points with Low baseline containing approximately 130 controls, Moderate
    325, and High 421. Organizations tailor baselines through the RMF Select step by adding
    controls for specific threats, removing inapplicable controls, and adjusting parameters.
    SP 800-53A provides assessment procedures and SP 800-53B defines baseline allocations.
    The enhancement structure enables proportional security that scales with system criticality,
    ensuring every security domain and attack vector has corresponding controls without
    requiring custom requirement development.
