# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    MITRE D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense) is
    a knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasure techniques that provides a complementary
    defensive taxonomy to MITRE ATT&CK's offensive technique catalog. Funded by the NSA and
    maintained by MITRE, D3FEND catalogs defensive techniques organized into five tactical
    categories: Harden, Detect, Isolate, Deceive, and Evict. Each defensive technique is
    linked to the specific ATT&CK offensive techniques it counters, the digital artifacts it
    operates on, and the underlying technology components involved. D3FEND uses an ontological
    knowledge graph structure rather than a simple matrix, enabling precise reasoning about
    defensive capability relationships.
  why: >-
    While ATT&CK provides extensive documentation of offensive techniques, the cybersecurity
    community lacked an equivalent standardized taxonomy for defensive countermeasures. Security
    architects and analysts needed a systematic way to map defensive capabilities to specific
    threats, identify gaps in defensive coverage, and make informed decisions about which
    countermeasures to deploy against specific attack techniques. D3FEND fills this gap by
    providing a structured, evidence-based catalog of defensive techniques with explicit
    mappings to ATT&CK, enabling threat-informed defense architecture.
  how: >-
    D3FEND is organized into five defensive tactic categories: (1) Harden - techniques that
    increase the difficulty of attack, including application hardening, credential hardening,
    message hardening, and platform hardening; (2) Detect - techniques for identifying
    adversary activity including file analysis, identifier analysis, message analysis, network
    traffic analysis, and process analysis; (3) Isolate - techniques that create logical or
    physical barriers including execution isolation, network isolation, and hardware-based
    isolation; (4) Deceive - techniques that mislead adversaries including decoy environments,
    decoy objects, and decoy personas; (5) Evict - techniques that remove adversary presence
    including credential eviction, file eviction, and process eviction. Each technique is
    linked to ATT&CK techniques it counters via the knowledge graph ontology.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Defensive Technique Taxonomy"
      value: >-
        A standardized classification of cybersecurity countermeasures organized into five
        tactical categories (Harden, Detect, Isolate, Deceive, Evict) providing a common
        language for describing defensive capabilities.
    - key: "ATT&CK-D3FEND Cross-Reference"
      value: >-
        Explicit mappings between D3FEND defensive techniques and the ATT&CK offensive
        techniques they counter, enabling systematic identification of which defenses
        address which threats.
    - key: "Knowledge Graph Ontology"
      value: >-
        An ontological structure that models relationships between defensive techniques,
        digital artifacts, technology components, and offensive techniques, enabling
        precise reasoning about defensive architecture.
    - key: "Digital Artifact Model"
      value: >-
        The D3FEND model of digital objects (files, processes, network traffic, credentials)
        that defensive and offensive techniques operate on, providing the connective layer
        between attack and defense taxonomies.

    MITRE D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense) is a
    knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasure techniques complementing MITRE ATT&CK's
    offensive taxonomy. Funded by the NSA and maintained by MITRE, D3FEND catalogs defensive
    techniques in five categories: Harden, Detect, Isolate, Deceive, and Evict. Each defensive
    technique is linked to specific ATT&CK offensive techniques it counters, digital artifacts
    it operates on, and underlying technology components. The ontological knowledge graph
    structure enables precise reasoning about defensive capability relationships. D3FEND fills
    the gap where ATT&CK documents offensive techniques but the community lacked equivalent
    defensive countermeasure standardization. Security architects use D3FEND to map defensive
    capabilities to specific threats, identify coverage gaps, and make informed countermeasure
    deployment decisions. The framework enables threat-informed defense architecture by providing
    explicit attack-defense mappings through the knowledge graph ontology linking digital
    artifacts, offensive techniques, and defensive countermeasures.
