definition:
  what: "GRSec Compliance 001 is the foundational compliance standard within the GR (GotRoot) security ontology that defines the baseline security control requirements for infrastructure and application environments governed by the GR framework. It establishes the minimum acceptable security posture across all layers and zones of the GR coordinate system, mapping internal compliance requirements to external standards such as NIST SP 800-53, CIS Controls, and ISO 27001. The standard covers access control, network segmentation, encryption requirements, logging and monitoring, vulnerability management, and incident response across the full infrastructure stack."
  why: "Organizations need a unified internal compliance standard that translates multiple external regulatory and industry requirements into a coherent set of controls mapped to their specific infrastructure architecture. GRSec Compliance 001 provides this translation layer, ensuring that compliance activities are aligned with the GR ontology's layer and zone model, enabling precise control mapping and gap analysis across the entire technology stack."
  how: "GRSec Compliance 001 is implemented by mapping each control requirement to specific GR layers and zones, identifying the infrastructure atoms affected, assessing current compliance status through automated scanning and manual review, remediating identified gaps, and maintaining continuous compliance through monitoring and periodic reassessment. The standard integrates with the GR atom system to enable traceability from high-level compliance requirements through control families to specific infrastructure components and their configurations."
