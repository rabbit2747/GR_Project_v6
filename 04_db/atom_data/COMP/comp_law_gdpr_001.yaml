# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >
    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law enacted
    by the European Union, effective since 25 May 2018. It regulates the processing of personal
    data of individuals within the EU and European Economic Area (EEA). GDPR applies to any
    organization worldwide that processes personal data of EU/EEA residents, regardless of the
    organization's location. It establishes data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure,
    portability, objection), mandates lawful bases for processing, requires data protection by
    design and by default, and imposes strict breach notification timelines of 72 hours.
  why: >
    GDPR represents the most significant global privacy regulation, with enforcement fines of up
    to 20 million EUR or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is higher. It has driven a
    worldwide shift toward stronger data protection practices and has influenced the creation of
    similar laws in other jurisdictions (CCPA, LGPD, POPIA). For security teams, GDPR mandates
    technical measures including encryption, pseudonymization, access controls, and breach
    detection capabilities.
  how: >
    Organizations achieve GDPR compliance by appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO) where
    required, conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), establishing lawful bases
    for all processing activities, implementing privacy by design and by default, maintaining
    Records of Processing Activities (ROPA), deploying technical and organizational security
    measures per Article 32, establishing data breach notification procedures, managing data
    subject requests, and ensuring lawful cross-border data transfer mechanisms.

    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European Union's comprehensive data
    protection law, effective since May 2018 under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It governs the
    processing of personal data of EU/EEA residents and applies extraterritorially to any
    organization worldwide handling such data. Key provisions include data subject rights (access,
    rectification, erasure, portability), six lawful bases for processing, mandatory Data Protection
    Impact Assessments, 72-hour breach notification, privacy by design and by default, and
    requirements for technical security measures. Penalties reach up to 20 million EUR or 4% of
    global annual turnover. GDPR has become the benchmark for global privacy legislation.
