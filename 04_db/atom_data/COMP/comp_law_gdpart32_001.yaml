definition:
  what: >
    GDPR Article 32 requires data controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical
    and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing
    personal data. The article explicitly references four categories of measures: (a) pseudonymization
    and encryption of personal data, (b) the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity,
    availability, and resilience of processing systems and services, (c) the ability to restore
    availability and access to personal data in a timely manner following a physical or technical
    incident, and (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness
    of technical and organizational measures.
  why: >
    Article 32 is the primary GDPR provision linking data protection directly to information
    security. It bridges privacy law and cybersecurity by requiring risk-based security controls
    proportionate to the sensitivity and volume of personal data processed. Failure to implement
    adequate security measures can result in administrative fines up to 10 million EUR or 2% of
    global annual turnover, and additionally creates liability for damages resulting from data
    breaches.
  how: >
    Organizations implement Article 32 by conducting risk assessments of their data processing
    activities, deploying encryption for data at rest and in transit, applying pseudonymization
    to reduce re-identification risk, implementing access controls and authentication mechanisms,
    establishing backup and disaster recovery procedures, conducting regular penetration testing
    and vulnerability assessments, maintaining incident response plans, and performing periodic
    reviews of security measure effectiveness. The measures must account for the state of the art,
    implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

    GDPR Article 32 requires controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and
    organizational measures to ensure security of personal data processing. It explicitly mandates
    four categories of measures: pseudonymization and encryption of personal data, ensuring ongoing
    confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of systems, the ability to restore
    data access after incidents, and regular testing and evaluation of security effectiveness.
    The article adopts a risk-based approach requiring measures proportionate to the processing
    risk, considering state of the art, implementation costs, and data sensitivity. Non-compliance
    carries fines up to 10 million EUR or 2% of global annual turnover.
