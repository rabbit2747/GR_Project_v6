# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally
    accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world
    observations. Maintained by the MITRE Corporation and first published in 2015, ATT&CK
    documents adversary behavior across the entire attack lifecycle organized into 14 tactics
    (reconnaissance through impact) with over 200 techniques and 400 sub-techniques as of
    version 15. The framework covers three technology domains: Enterprise (Windows, macOS,
    Linux, Cloud, Network, Containers), Mobile (Android, iOS), and ICS (Industrial Control
    Systems). Each technique entry includes descriptions, procedure examples from real threat
    groups, detection guidance, and mitigation recommendations.
  why: >-
    Prior to ATT&CK, the cybersecurity community lacked a standardized, evidence-based
    taxonomy for describing adversary behavior at the operational level. Existing models
    like the Cyber Kill Chain provided high-level phases but lacked the granularity needed
    for detection engineering, threat intelligence sharing, and security assessment. ATT&CK
    provides a common language that enables defenders to describe threats consistently,
    map detection capabilities to specific adversary behaviors, assess security product
    coverage, conduct gap analysis, prioritize defensive investments based on real threat
    intelligence, and perform adversary emulation for red team and purple team exercises.
  how: >-
    ATT&CK is structured as a matrix with tactics as columns and techniques as rows:
    (1) Tactics represent the adversary's tactical objective (the why): Reconnaissance,
    Resource Development, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation,
    Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command
    and Control, Exfiltration, and Impact; (2) Techniques describe specific methods adversaries
    use to achieve tactical objectives (the how), with sub-techniques providing additional
    granularity; (3) Each technique links to documented threat groups that use it, software
    tools associated with it, detection data sources, and recommended mitigations;
    (4) Organizations use ATT&CK for threat intelligence enrichment, detection rule development,
    red team planning, security assessment, and vendor evaluation through ATT&CK Evaluations.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Tactics"
      value: >-
        The 14 high-level categories representing adversary objectives during an attack,
        from initial Reconnaissance through Impact, providing the strategic context for why
        an adversary performs specific techniques.
    - key: "Techniques and Sub-Techniques"
      value: >-
        Over 200 techniques and 400 sub-techniques documenting specific methods adversaries
        use to achieve tactical objectives, each backed by real-world observations and
        linked to threat group usage, detection data sources, and mitigations.
    - key: "Threat Group Profiles"
      value: >-
        Documentation of over 140 named threat groups with their associated techniques,
        software tools, and target sectors, enabling organizations to understand which
        adversary behaviors are most relevant to their threat landscape.
    - key: "Data Sources and Detections"
      value: >-
        Structured mapping of the telemetry sources and detection logic required to identify
        each technique, enabling security teams to build detection rules and assess monitoring
        coverage systematically.
    - key: "ATT&CK Matrix Domains"
      value: >-
        Three technology domain matrices covering Enterprise (Windows, macOS, Linux, Cloud,
        Network, Containers), Mobile (Android, iOS), and ICS (Industrial Control Systems),
        each tailored to the specific attack surface and adversary behaviors relevant to
        that domain.

    MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally
    accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
    First published in 2015, ATT&CK documents adversary behavior across 14 tactics from
    reconnaissance through impact, with over 200 techniques and 400 sub-techniques covering
    Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS domains. Each technique includes real-world procedure examples
    from over 140 documented threat groups, detection data sources, and mitigation recommendations.
    ATT&CK provides the common language enabling threat intelligence sharing, detection rule
    development, security product evaluation, red team planning, and defensive gap analysis.
    The framework addresses the lack of standardized operational-level adversary behavior taxonomy
    that existed prior to its creation. Organizations use ATT&CK to map detection capabilities,
    assess coverage through heatmaps, conduct adversary emulation, evaluate security products
    through ATT&CK Evaluations, and prioritize defensive investments based on real threat
    intelligence about adversary groups targeting their sector.
