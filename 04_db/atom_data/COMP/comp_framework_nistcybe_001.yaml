# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary framework developed by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology for improving cybersecurity risk management in critical
    infrastructure and organizations. Originally published in February 2014 under Executive
    Order 13636, with version 1.1 released in April 2018, the CSF provides a common language
    and systematic methodology for managing cybersecurity risk. The framework consists of three
    components: the Core (functions, categories, subcategories), Implementation Tiers (Partial,
    Risk Informed, Repeatable, Adaptive), and Profiles (current and target cybersecurity posture).
    The original CSF organized activities into five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect,
    Respond, and Recover.
  why: >-
    Prior to the CSF, organizations lacked a widely accepted, technology-neutral framework for
    communicating cybersecurity risk management practices across organizational levels and between
    organizations. Executive Order 13636 directed NIST to develop a framework to reduce
    cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure. The CSF addresses this by providing a
    common taxonomy that enables organizations to describe their current cybersecurity posture,
    identify target states, assess gaps, and communicate risk management priorities to
    stakeholders including executives, regulators, and business partners.
  how: >-
    The CSF is implemented through three components: (1) Framework Core - five functions
    (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) with 23 categories and 108 subcategories
    describing cybersecurity outcomes; (2) Implementation Tiers - four levels describing the
    degree to which cybersecurity risk management practices are integrated and adaptive;
    (3) Framework Profiles - alignment of functions, categories, and subcategories with
    business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources to create current-state and target-state
    descriptions. Organizations use the CSF by creating a current profile, developing a target
    profile, conducting gap analysis, and implementing an action plan to close identified gaps.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Framework Core"
      value: >-
        The set of cybersecurity activities and outcomes organized into functions, categories,
        and subcategories that provide a comprehensive view of cybersecurity risk management.
    - key: "Framework Profiles"
      value: >-
        Organizational alignment of cybersecurity activities with business requirements and
        risk tolerance, enabling current-state assessment and target-state planning for
        cybersecurity posture improvement.
    - key: "Implementation Tiers"
      value: >-
        Four maturity levels describing how organizations manage cybersecurity risk, from
        Partial (ad hoc) to Adaptive (continuously improving based on risk analysis).
    - key: "Informative References"
      value: >-
        Mappings from CSF subcategories to specific sections of existing standards and
        guidelines (NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, COBIT, CIS Controls) that provide
        implementation guidance for achieving desired outcomes.

    The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary framework for improving cybersecurity risk
    management originally published in 2014 under Executive Order 13636, with version 1.1
    released in 2018. The CSF provides a common language and methodology for managing
    cybersecurity risk through three components: the Core organizing activities into five
    functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) with 23 categories and 108
    subcategories; Implementation Tiers describing maturity from Partial to Adaptive; and
    Profiles aligning cybersecurity activities with business requirements. Organizations
    create current and target profiles, conduct gap analysis, and implement action plans.
    The framework maps to existing standards through informative references including NIST SP
    800-53, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls. CSF addresses the lack of a widely accepted,
    technology-neutral framework for communicating cybersecurity risk across organizational
    levels. It has been superseded by CSF 2.0 which adds the Govern function and expands
    scope beyond critical infrastructure to all organizations.
