# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    NIST SP 800-63B (Digital Identity Guidelines - Authentication and Lifecycle Management)
    provides technical requirements for authentication and authenticator lifecycle management
    as part of the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines suite (SP 800-63 series). The publication
    defines three Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL1, AAL2, AAL3) with increasing requirements
    for authentication strength, and specifies requirements for various authenticator types
    including passwords, OTP devices, cryptographic authenticators, and biometrics. Notably,
    SP 800-63B Rev. 3 modernized password guidance by eliminating arbitrary complexity rules
    and periodic rotation requirements in favor of length-based requirements and breach
    database checking.
  why: >-
    Authentication is the primary mechanism for verifying user identity in digital systems,
    and weak authentication is consistently among the top causes of security breaches. Prior
    password policies based on complexity rules and mandatory rotation were demonstrated to
    reduce security by encouraging predictable patterns and password reuse. SP 800-63B
    provides evidence-based authentication guidance that improves security while reducing user
    friction, establishing assurance levels that organizations can select based on risk
    assessment and the sensitivity of protected resources.
  how: >-
    SP 800-63B defines three authenticator assurance levels: (1) AAL1 - single-factor
    authentication providing some assurance, accepting memorized secrets (passwords with
    minimum 8 characters, checked against breach databases, no composition rules required),
    single-factor OTP devices, or single-factor cryptographic devices; (2) AAL2 - two-factor
    authentication providing high confidence, requiring two distinct authentication factors
    from something you know, something you have, or something you are; (3) AAL3 - hardware-
    based authentication providing very high confidence, requiring a hardware cryptographic
    authenticator plus verifier impersonation resistance. Password requirements include
    minimum 8 characters (64 character maximum support), no composition rules, no periodic
    rotation unless compromise is suspected, and screening against commonly used and breached
    password databases.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL)"
      value: >-
        Three tiers of authentication strength: AAL1 (single-factor), AAL2 (two-factor),
        and AAL3 (hardware-based cryptographic) providing graduated assurance levels for
        risk-proportional authentication.
    - key: "Modernized Password Guidelines"
      value: >-
        Evidence-based password requirements eliminating arbitrary complexity rules and
        mandatory rotation in favor of length requirements, breach database screening,
        and user-friendly policies that improve both security and usability.
    - key: "Multi-Factor Authentication"
      value: >-
        Authentication using two or more distinct factors from knowledge, possession, and
        inherence categories, required at AAL2 and AAL3 for high-assurance identity
        verification.
    - key: "Phishing-Resistant Authentication"
      value: >-
        AAL3 requirement for verifier impersonation resistance using hardware-based
        cryptographic authenticators (e.g., FIDO2/WebAuthn) that cannot be phished through
        social engineering or man-in-the-middle attacks.

    NIST SP 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines Authentication and Lifecycle Management defines
    three Authenticator Assurance Levels with requirements for authentication strength. AAL1
    accepts single-factor authentication, AAL2 requires two-factor, and AAL3 mandates hardware
    cryptographic authenticators with phishing resistance. The publication modernized password
    guidance by eliminating arbitrary complexity rules and periodic rotation in favor of length
    requirements minimum 8 characters and breach database screening. Various authenticator
    types are specified including passwords, OTP devices, cryptographic authenticators, and
    biometrics. SP 800-63B addresses weak authentication as a top breach cause by providing
    evidence-based guidance improving security while reducing user friction. Organizations
    select assurance levels based on risk assessment and resource sensitivity. The guidelines
    support zero trust architecture identity verification and implement SP 800-53 Identification
    and Authentication controls. AAL3 phishing-resistant authentication using FIDO2 and WebAuthn
    provides the highest assurance against credential theft and social engineering.
