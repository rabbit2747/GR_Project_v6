# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory agency of the
    United States Department of Commerce that develops cybersecurity standards, guidelines,
    best practices, and frameworks used globally. NIST's Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)
    and Computer Security Division (CSD) produce the Special Publication (SP) 800 series,
    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), and cybersecurity frameworks that serve
    as the authoritative baseline for information security in federal agencies and are widely
    adopted by private sector organizations worldwide. Key publications include the Cybersecurity
    Framework (CSF), Risk Management Framework (RMF), and the SP 800-53 security controls catalog.
  why: >-
    Organizations need authoritative, evidence-based cybersecurity guidance developed through
    rigorous research and public-private collaboration. NIST fills this role by providing
    technology-neutral, risk-based frameworks that organizations can adapt to their specific
    environments. Federal agencies are required to comply with NIST standards under FISMA and
    executive orders, while private sector organizations adopt NIST frameworks as industry best
    practice. NIST standards provide the common foundation that enables consistent security
    posture assessment, regulatory compliance, supply chain assurance, and international
    cybersecurity cooperation.
  how: >-
    NIST cybersecurity guidance is organized into several publication series: (1) NIST
    Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) - voluntary framework for managing cybersecurity risk
    organized into six functions; (2) SP 800 Series - detailed technical guidelines covering
    specific security domains including risk management (SP 800-37 RMF), security controls
    (SP 800-53), incident response (SP 800-61), zero trust (SP 800-207), and authentication
    (SP 800-63); (3) FIPS Standards - mandatory standards for federal systems including
    cryptographic requirements (FIPS 140-3, FIPS 197); (4) NIST develops standards through
    open, collaborative processes involving public comment periods, workshops, and partnership
    with industry, academia, and international standards bodies.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "SP 800 Series"
      value: >-
        The comprehensive series of Special Publications providing detailed cybersecurity
        guidelines covering risk management, security controls, incident response, identity
        management, cryptography, cloud security, zero trust, and numerous other domains.
    - key: "Risk-Based Approach"
      value: >-
        NIST frameworks emphasize risk management rather than compliance checklists, enabling
        organizations to prioritize security investments based on their specific threat
        landscape, business requirements, and risk appetite.
    - key: "Open Standards Development"
      value: >-
        NIST develops cybersecurity standards through transparent, collaborative processes
        involving public comment periods, industry workshops, and partnership with academia
        and international standards organizations.
    - key: "Federal Mandate and Global Adoption"
      value: >-
        While mandatory for U.S. federal agencies under FISMA, NIST frameworks are voluntarily
        adopted worldwide as industry best practice, referenced by regulations, and used as
        the basis for international cybersecurity standards.
