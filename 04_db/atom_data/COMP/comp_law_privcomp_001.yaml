  what: >
    Privacy Compliance is the discipline of ensuring that an organization's collection, processing,
    storage, sharing, and disposal of personal data conforms to applicable privacy laws and
    regulations. This encompasses a growing patchwork of global privacy legislation including
    the EU's GDPR, California's CCPA/CPRA, Brazil's LGPD, Canada's PIPEDA, Japan's APPI,
    South Korea's PIPA, China's PIPL, India's DPDP Act, and numerous other national and
    sub-national data protection laws. Privacy compliance requires organizations to understand
    their data processing activities, establish lawful bases for processing, respect data subject
    rights, implement appropriate security measures, and maintain accountability through
    documentation and governance structures.
  why: >
    The global proliferation of privacy laws means that virtually every organization handling
    personal data is subject to one or more privacy regulations. The combined penalty exposure
    across multiple jurisdictions can be enormous, with GDPR fines reaching 4% of global turnover,
    CCPA penalties of $7,500 per intentional violation, and emerging laws in China and India
    imposing their own penalty structures. Beyond financial penalties, privacy failures erode
    customer trust, damage brand reputation, and create competitive disadvantage as privacy
    becomes a market differentiator.
  how: >
    Organizations build privacy compliance programs by conducting data mapping and inventory
    exercises, performing privacy impact assessments, establishing privacy governance structures
    (DPO, privacy steering committee), implementing consent management and preference centers,
    building data subject rights fulfillment processes, deploying privacy-enhancing technologies
    (encryption, anonymization, pseudonymization), establishing data retention and deletion
    policies, managing third-party data processing agreements, implementing cross-border transfer
    mechanisms, and conducting regular privacy audits and training programs.

    Privacy Compliance is the discipline of ensuring organizational adherence to applicable

    It encompasses a global patchwork of regulations including GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, LGPD, PIPEDA,
    APPI, PIPA, PIPL, and the DPDP Act. Key activities include data mapping, privacy impact
    assessments, consent management, data subject rights fulfillment, privacy-enhancing
    technologies deployment, data retention policies, third-party agreement management, and
    cross-border transfer compliance. Organizations face combined penalty exposure across
    multiple jurisdictions with GDPR fines up to 4% of global turnover. Privacy compliance
    programs require governance structures, regular audits, and continuous regulatory monitoring.
