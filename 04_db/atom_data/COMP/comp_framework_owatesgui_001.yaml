  what: >-
    The OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) is a comprehensive methodology for testing
    the security of web applications and web services. The guide provides a complete framework
    of security test cases organized into 12 categories: Information Gathering, Configuration
    and Deployment Management, Identity Management, Authentication, Authorization, Session
    Management, Input Validation, Error Handling, Cryptography, Business Logic, Client-Side
    Testing, and API Testing. Each test case includes a unique identifier (WSTG-xxxx-nn),
    summary, test objectives, step-by-step testing procedures, expected results, remediation
    guidance, and references. The guide covers both black-box and gray-box testing approaches
    and serves as the standard reference for web application penetration testing.
  why: >-
    Web application security testing requires a systematic, repeatable methodology to ensure
    consistent coverage across all vulnerability categories. Without a standardized testing
    framework, penetration testers and security assessors produce inconsistent results based
    on individual experience and tool selection. The OWASP Testing Guide addresses this by
    providing a complete catalog of test cases that ensures comprehensive coverage of all
    common web application vulnerability categories, enabling organizations to set minimum
    testing standards, measure assessment quality, and ensure that critical vulnerability
    classes are not overlooked during security reviews.
  how: >-
    The OWASP Testing Guide is applied through a structured testing process: (1) Information
    Gathering - passive and active reconnaissance to understand the application attack surface
    including technology fingerprinting, content discovery, and application mapping;
    (2) Configuration Testing - evaluating deployment security, platform configuration,
    file handling, and HTTP security headers; (3) Identity and Authentication Testing -
    assessing user registration, credential policies, authentication mechanisms, and account
    lockout; (4) Authorization Testing - verifying access control enforcement, privilege
    escalation, and insecure direct object references; (5) Session Management Testing -
    evaluating session token generation, handling, timeout, and fixation vulnerabilities;
    (6) Input Validation Testing - testing for injection flaws including SQL injection, XSS,
    command injection, and other input-based attacks; (7) Business Logic Testing - identifying
    application-specific logic flaws; (8) Client-Side Testing - evaluating browser-based
    vulnerabilities. Each test case follows a standardized format enabling consistent execution
    and reporting.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Standardized Test Case Framework"
      value: >-
        Uniquely identified test cases (WSTG-xxxx-nn) with consistent structure including
        summary, objectives, procedures, and remediation, enabling repeatable and measurable
        security assessments across different testers and engagements.
    - key: "Comprehensive Vulnerability Coverage"
      value: >-
        Twelve testing categories covering all major web application vulnerability classes
        from information gathering through client-side and API testing, ensuring no common
        vulnerability category is overlooked during security assessments.
    - key: "Methodology-Agnostic Approach"
      value: >-
        Test cases applicable to both black-box and gray-box testing methodologies, with
        manual testing procedures that complement automated scanning and provide deeper
        vulnerability analysis than tools alone.
