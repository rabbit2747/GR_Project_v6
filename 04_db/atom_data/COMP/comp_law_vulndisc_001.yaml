definition:
  what: >
    Vulnerability Disclosure is the process and legal framework governing how security
    vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or services are reported to affected vendors and
    subsequently communicated to the public. Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) follows
    a structured approach where the discoverer reports the vulnerability to the vendor privately,
    the vendor develops and deploys a fix within an agreed timeline (typically 90 days), and
    the vulnerability is then publicly disclosed. This process is formalized through standards
    such as ISO/IEC 29147:2018 (Vulnerability disclosure) and ISO/IEC 30111:2019 (Vulnerability
    handling processes), and is increasingly mandated by regulations including the EU Cyber
    Resilience Act, US Executive Order 14028 on Improving Cybersecurity, and CISA's vulnerability
    disclosure policy requirements.
  why: >
    Vulnerability disclosure mechanisms are essential for the security ecosystem because they
    provide incentives for researchers to report findings constructively rather than exploiting
    them or selling them on dark markets. Without clear disclosure processes, organizations
    face increased risk of zero-day exploitation, researchers face legal uncertainty, and the
    overall security posture of the technology ecosystem degrades. Regulatory mandates (EU CRA,
    NIS2 Directive, US EO 14028) increasingly require organizations to maintain vulnerability
    disclosure processes, making this a compliance obligation beyond a security best practice.
  how: >
    Organizations implement vulnerability disclosure through establishing a Vulnerability
    Disclosure Policy (VDP) that defines scope, authorized testing activities, safe harbor
    provisions, and reporting channels. Technical implementation includes publishing a
    security.txt file (RFC 9116), creating dedicated security contact information, deploying
    bug bounty programs through platforms like HackerOne or Bugcrowd, establishing internal
    vulnerability triage and response workflows, coordinating with CERT/CC or other coordination
    centers, assigning CVE identifiers through CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) programs, and
    publishing security advisories with remediation guidance.

    Vulnerability Disclosure is the process and legal framework for reporting security
    vulnerabilities to affected vendors and communicating them to the public. Coordinated
    Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) involves private reporting, agreed remediation timelines
    (typically 90 days), and coordinated public disclosure. Formalized through ISO/IEC 29147
    and ISO/IEC 30111, it is increasingly mandated by regulations including the EU Cyber
    Resilience Act, NIS2, and US Executive Order 14028. Implementation includes Vulnerability
    Disclosure Policies, security.txt files (RFC 9116), bug bounty programs, CVE assignment
    through CNA programs, and coordination with CERT/CC. Safe harbor provisions protect
    security researchers conducting authorized testing within defined scope.
