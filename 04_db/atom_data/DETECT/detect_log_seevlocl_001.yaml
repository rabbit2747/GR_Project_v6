definition:
  what: >-
    Security Event Log Cleared is a specific, high-fidelity detection pattern for Windows Event
    ID 1102, which is generated exclusively when the Windows Security event log is cleared. This
    event is unique in that it survives the clearing operation — it is written as the first entry
    in the newly emptied Security log, ensuring that evidence of the clearing action is always
    preserved. The event records the Subject Security ID, Account Name, Account Domain, and Logon
    ID of the user who performed the clearing. This is distinct from the generic Event Log Clear
    Event (Event ID 104) which covers clearing of any event log channel. Event ID 1102 specifically
    targets the Security log, which contains the most critical security telemetry including
    authentication events, privilege use, object access, and policy changes.
  why: >-
    The Security event log is the primary audit trail for Windows systems and the most valuable
    target for attackers seeking to destroy evidence. Clearing the Security log eliminates records
    of failed logons, privilege escalation, lateral movement, credential access, and policy
    modifications. Event ID 1102 is classified as one of the highest-confidence indicators of
    compromise in Windows security monitoring because there are very few legitimate operational
    reasons to clear the Security log. MITRE ATT&CK maps this to T1070.001 (Indicator Removal:
    Clear Windows Event Logs). Security frameworks including CIS Benchmarks, PCI DSS, and SOX
    require alerting on Security log clearing events. This event should trigger immediate
    incident response investigation.
  how: >-
    Security Event Log Cleared detection operates through: (1) Direct monitoring of Event ID
    1102 in the Windows Security log, which provides the user identity who cleared the log;
    (2) Immediate SIEM alerting configured as a critical/high severity rule with no suppression
    or aggregation delay; (3) Correlation with preceding events to identify what evidence may
    have been destroyed — including the last known Security log events before clearing; (4)
    Investigation of the Subject account to determine if it was compromised; (5) Windows Event
    Forwarding (WEF) ensuring that Event ID 1102 is forwarded in real-time to central
    collection; (6) Validation that backup copies of the Security log exist in SIEM or archive
    storage prior to the clearing; (7) Automated incident response workflows that isolate the
    affected system and escalate to the SOC.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Self-Documenting Clear Event"
      value: "Event ID 1102 is uniquely designed to survive Security log clearing, ensuring that the act of clearing is always recorded even when all other Security log events are destroyed."
    - key: "Subject Attribution"
      value: "The event records the Security ID, Account Name, and Logon ID of the user who cleared the log, enabling attribution of the clearing action to a specific identity."
    - key: "Evidence Destruction Scope"
      value: "Clearing the Security log destroys authentication records, privilege use events, object access logs, and policy change records — the most forensically valuable Windows telemetry."

  embedding_text: >-
    Security Event Log Cleared is a high-fidelity detection pattern for Windows Event ID 1102,
    generated exclusively when the Security event log is cleared. This self-documenting event
    survives the clearing operation and records the Subject Security ID, Account Name, and Logon
    ID of the responsible user. Clearing the Security log destroys authentication records,
    privilege use events, and policy change logs — the most forensically valuable Windows
    telemetry. Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK T1070.001, this is one of the highest-confidence
    indicators of compromise with very few legitimate operational justifications. Detection
    requires immediate critical-severity SIEM alerting with no suppression, real-time WEF
    forwarding, and automated incident response escalation.
