definition:
  what: "Firmware Logs is an endpoint detection pattern that collects and analyzes log entries generated by firmware components during and after the boot process, including UEFI event logs, BIOS POST diagnostic records, BMC system event logs, TPM event logs, and Secure Boot violation records. These logs capture firmware initialization sequences, hardware configuration changes, boot device selection, Secure Boot policy enforcement events, firmware update operations, and error conditions encountered during the pre-OS boot phase."
  why: "Firmware logs provide unique visibility into the earliest stages of system operation that are invisible to operating system-level security tools. Analyzing these logs enables detection of boot-level attacks including Secure Boot policy violations, bootloader modifications, unauthorized firmware updates, TPM seal/unseal failures indicating platform integrity changes, and BMC configuration tampering. Firmware log analysis is critical for identifying advanced persistent threats that operate below the OS layer and for forensic investigation of systems suspected of firmware-level compromise."
  how: "Firmware log collection is achieved through standardized interfaces including the UEFI Runtime Services GetVariable interface for accessing UEFI event logs, IPMI commands for retrieving BMC System Event Logs, TCG Event Log parsing for TPM measurement records, and Windows Event Log channels dedicated to Secure Boot and Measured Boot events. Endpoint agents periodically collect and forward these logs to central analysis platforms. Detection rules flag Secure Boot violations, unexpected boot configuration changes, firmware update events from unauthorized sources, TPM PCR value changes between boots, and BMC access from unexpected network addresses."
