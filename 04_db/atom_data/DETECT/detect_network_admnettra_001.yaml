# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "A network detection pattern focused on identifying and monitoring traffic generated by administrative protocols and management tools such as SSH, RDP, SNMP, WinRM, and similar remote administration services. This pattern establishes baselines for normal administrative activity and flags deviations that may indicate unauthorized access, lateral movement, or abuse of legitimate management channels by adversaries."
  why: "Administrative protocols carry elevated privileges and provide direct access to system configuration and control. Attackers frequently abuse these protocols for lateral movement, persistence, and command-and-control. Monitoring administrative traffic is critical for detecting unauthorized use of management channels, credential theft exploitation, and insider threats operating through legitimate administrative pathways."
  how: "Detection is achieved by cataloging all administrative protocol traffic (SSH on port 22, RDP on port 3389, SNMP on ports 161/162, WinRM on port 5985/5986, Telnet on port 23, VNC on ports 5900+) and establishing behavioral baselines. Traffic is analyzed for anomalies including unusual source-destination pairs, connections from non-admin workstations, off-hours activity, abnormal session durations, and unexpected protocol usage. Flow metadata, packet inspection, and session correlation are combined to identify suspicious administrative access patterns."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Management Plane Visibility"
      value: "Continuous monitoring of all protocols used for system administration and remote management to detect misuse."
    - key: "Baseline Deviation"
      value: "Establishing normal administrative traffic patterns and alerting when activity deviates from expected behavior profiles."
    - key: "Privileged Access Monitoring"
      value: "Tracking connections that grant elevated access to systems, ensuring only authorized personnel use administrative channels."
    - key: "Protocol Enumeration"
      value: "Maintaining a comprehensive inventory of administrative protocols in use across the network to prevent blind spots."

It establishes behavioral baselines for normal administrative activity and identifies anomalies such as unauthorized source-destination pairs, off-hours connections, abnormal session durations, and unexpected protocol usage. This detection capability is critical for identifying lateral movement, credential abuse, and insider threats that leverage legitimate administrative channels to move through the network with elevated privileges."
