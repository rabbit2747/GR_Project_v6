definition:
  what: >-
    A Security Event is the fundamental unit of security-relevant information recorded by
    operating systems, applications, network devices, and security infrastructure. It represents
    any observable occurrence that has significance for the security posture of a system or
    network. Security events encompass a broad taxonomy including authentication events (logon,
    logoff, failed login), authorization events (privilege use, access granted/denied), system
    events (service start/stop, policy changes), object access events (file, registry, directory
    access), account management events (user creation, modification, deletion), and network
    events (connection established, firewall actions, DNS queries). On Windows, security events
    are recorded in the Security event log with specific Event IDs categorized by audit policy.
    On Linux, they are captured through syslog, auditd, and systemd journal. Security events
    form the raw data layer upon which all detection, correlation, and forensic analysis is built.
  why: >-
    Security events are the foundational data source for the entire detection and response
    lifecycle. Without comprehensive security event collection, organizations cannot detect
    intrusions, investigate incidents, demonstrate compliance, or perform forensic analysis.
    Security events feed into SIEM correlation engines, threat hunting workflows, automated
    response playbooks, and compliance reporting systems. The quality, completeness, and
    integrity of security event data directly determines an organization's ability to detect
    threats, respond to incidents, and maintain regulatory compliance. Failure to collect and
    monitor security events is consistently identified as a root cause in post-breach analyses.
  how: >-
    Security event management operates through: (1) Event generation by operating systems,
    applications, and security tools based on configured audit policies and logging levels;
    (2) Local event storage in platform-specific formats (Windows .evtx, Linux syslog/journal,
    application logs); (3) Event collection via agents (Beats, NXLog, Fluentd), agentless
    collection (WEF, syslog forwarding), or API-based collection (cloud audit APIs); (4) Event
    normalization to common schemas (CEF, LEEF, ECS, OCSF) for cross-platform analysis; (5)
    Centralized storage in SIEM platforms, data lakes, or log management systems; (6) Real-time
    correlation against detection rules, threat intelligence, and behavioral baselines; (7)
    Alerting, investigation, and response workflows triggered by correlated security events;
    (8) Long-term retention for compliance and forensic requirements.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Audit Policy"
      value: "Configuration that determines which categories of security events are generated, balancing detection coverage against storage and performance requirements."
    - key: "Event Normalization"
      value: "The process of converting security events from diverse source formats into a common schema for consistent cross-platform analysis and correlation."
    - key: "Event Correlation"
      value: "The process of analyzing relationships between multiple security events to identify patterns indicative of attacks, policy violations, or anomalous behavior."
    - key: "Event Fidelity"
      value: "The completeness, accuracy, and integrity of security event data, which directly impacts detection effectiveness and forensic reliability."
