definition:
  what: >-
    An Event Log Archive Event is a log entry generated when an event log file is archived,
    backed up, or moved from its active storage location to long-term archive storage. On
    Windows systems this corresponds to events indicating that a log channel has been archived
    (such as Event ID 1105 in the Security log indicating the event log is full and has been
    archived). On Linux/Unix systems, this corresponds to logrotate archival operations or
    syslog archive events. The event typically records the log name, archive destination path,
    timestamp of archival, the size of the archived log, and the identity of the process or
    user that initiated the archival. This event is part of the event log lifecycle management
    chain and serves as an audit trail for log integrity and retention compliance.
  why: >-
    Event log archival monitoring is critical for maintaining log integrity and ensuring
    compliance with retention policies required by regulations such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX,
    and GDPR. Unexpected or unauthorized log archival operations may indicate an attacker
    attempting to manipulate the audit trail — archiving logs prematurely to cause the active
    log to reset, or modifying archive destinations to exfiltrate log data. Additionally,
    monitoring archival events ensures that log rotation and retention policies are functioning
    correctly, preventing log loss due to storage exhaustion. Forensic investigations depend on
    verifiable archive chains to establish the integrity and completeness of evidence.
  how: >-
    Event log archive events are detected by: (1) Monitoring Windows Event Log channels for
    archive-related event IDs such as Event ID 1105 in the Security log; (2) Monitoring
    logrotate status files and syslog messages on Linux for archive completion notifications;
    (3) Configuring SIEM rules to alert on unexpected archival events outside scheduled
    maintenance windows; (4) Validating that archive destinations match approved storage
    locations; (5) Correlating archival events with log size thresholds and retention policy
    schedules to identify anomalous archival patterns; (6) Verifying archive integrity through
    hash comparisons and chain-of-custody logging.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Log Retention Compliance"
      value: "Regulatory frameworks mandate specific log retention periods, and archive events provide the audit trail proving that logs are properly preserved for the required duration."
    - key: "Archive Chain of Custody"
      value: "The documented trail of log archival events that establishes provenance and integrity of archived logs for forensic and compliance purposes."

  embedding_text: >-
    Event Log Archive Event is a detection pattern for log entries generated when event logs
    are archived or backed up from active storage to long-term archive destinations. On Windows,
    this includes Event ID 1105 for Security log archival; on Linux, logrotate archive
    notifications. Monitoring archive events ensures log retention compliance with PCI DSS,
    HIPAA, SOX, and GDPR, detects unauthorized log manipulation attempts, validates archive
    destination integrity, and supports forensic chain-of-custody requirements. Unexpected
    archival outside maintenance windows or to unauthorized destinations warrants investigation
    as potential evidence tampering.
