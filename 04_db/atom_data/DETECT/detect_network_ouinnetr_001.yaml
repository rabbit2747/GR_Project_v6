# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "A network detection pattern that monitors and analyzes all traffic leaving the organization's network to internet destinations. This encompasses all outbound protocols, ports, and services communicating with external systems, providing comprehensive visibility into egress activity. The pattern establishes baselines for normal outbound traffic and detects anomalies indicative of data exfiltration, C2 communications, unauthorized external services, and malware callback activity."
  why: "Outbound internet traffic is the primary channel for post-compromise adversary activity including C2 communications, data exfiltration, and connections to adversary infrastructure. Monitoring all outbound traffic is essential for detecting compromised hosts, identifying data theft, and discovering unauthorized connections to external services. This is the most critical traffic direction for detecting active intrusions and ongoing adversary operations."
  how: "Detection captures all traffic at egress points through firewalls, proxies, and network sensors. Analysis includes: destination reputation scoring against threat intelligence; protocol and port analysis for unauthorized services; data volume monitoring for exfiltration indicators; connection timing analysis for C2 beaconing; geographic destination analysis; application identification through deep packet inspection; and behavioral baselining per host and subnet to detect anomalous outbound patterns. Integration with DLP, SIEM, and threat intelligence platforms enriches analysis."
  core_concepts:

      value: "Complete monitoring of all traffic leaving the network to internet destinations across all protocols."
    - key: "Outbound Baseline"
      value: "Establishing normal patterns for outbound traffic volume, destination distribution, and protocol usage."
    - key: "Destination Intelligence"
      value: "Enriching outbound traffic analysis with threat intelligence, domain reputation, and geographic context."
    - key: "C2 and Exfil Detection"
      value: "Identifying post-compromise activity including command-and-control communications and data exfiltration."

It establishes baselines for normal outbound patterns and detects anomalies including data exfiltration, C2 communications, unauthorized external services, and malware callbacks. Analysis includes destination reputation scoring, protocol analysis, data volume monitoring, timing analysis for beaconing, and geographic destination evaluation. This is the most critical traffic direction for detecting active intrusions and serves as the parent detection for specific outbound traffic types including web, encrypted, mail, and file transfer traffic."
