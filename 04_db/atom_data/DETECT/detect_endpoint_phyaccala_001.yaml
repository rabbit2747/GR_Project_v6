definition:
  what: "Physical Access Alarm Event is an endpoint detection pattern that captures hardware-generated alerts indicating physical access or tampering with endpoint equipment. This includes chassis intrusion switch events triggered when a computer case is opened, rack door sensors in data center environments, cable lock tamper alerts, hardware security module tamper detection, and baseboard management controller (BMC) physical presence assertions. The event is generated by hardware sensors and reported through BIOS/UEFI, BMC IPMI System Event Log entries, or operating system hardware monitoring interfaces."
  why: "Physical access alarms are critical security indicators because physical access to hardware enables severe attack vectors including hardware implant installation, memory forensics through cold boot attacks, direct disk access bypassing OS security controls, TPM physical reset attacks, and BIOS/UEFI modification through physical flash reprogramming. In regulated environments such as PCI DSS or government classified networks, physical tamper detection is a mandatory security control. Timely detection of unauthorized physical access enables rapid incident response before adversaries can complete hardware-level attacks."
  how: "Detection systems collect physical access alarm events from multiple hardware sources including BIOS/UEFI chassis intrusion detection reported through ACPI and SMBIOS, BMC IPMI Sensor Event Message entries for physical security sensors, TPM physical presence assertions, and hardware security module tamper response events. Endpoint agents query these sources periodically or receive asynchronous notifications. Detection rules correlate physical access alarms with the time of day, authorized maintenance windows, badge access system logs, and nearby camera footage references. Alarms outside maintenance windows or in locations without corresponding badge access trigger high-priority security incidents."
