# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "A detection pattern that identifies network reconnaissance and scanning activities by monitoring traffic directed at unused or unallocated IP address space within the internal network (intranet dark space). Since no legitimate services reside on these addresses, any traffic targeting dark space is inherently suspicious and indicates scanning, worm propagation, or misconfigured systems. This technique functions as an internal network telescope or honeypot at the network layer."
  why: "Network reconnaissance is a critical early phase of most attacks, occurring during both initial compromise and lateral movement. Monitoring dark space provides high-fidelity alerts with extremely low false positive rates because legitimate traffic should never target unallocated addresses. This makes it one of the most reliable indicators of active scanning, worm propagation, or attacker enumeration within the internal network."
  how: "Implementation involves identifying unused IP address ranges within the organization's allocated subnets and configuring monitoring to capture all traffic directed to these addresses. Traffic analysis examines source hosts generating dark space hits, the scanning patterns used (sequential, random, targeted subnet sweeps), port distributions being probed, and temporal patterns. Correlation with asset inventory databases ensures the dark space map remains current. Alerts trigger on any traffic to monitored dark addresses, with severity escalation based on scan velocity, coverage breadth, and source host criticality."
  core_concepts:

      value: "Unused or unallocated IP addresses within an organization's address space that should receive no legitimate traffic."
    - key: "Network Telescope"
