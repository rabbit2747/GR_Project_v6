definition:
  what: >-
    A Hunt Report is a structured document produced at the conclusion of a proactive threat
    hunting mission that records the hypothesis, methodology, data sources queried, findings,
    indicators of compromise (IOCs) discovered, and recommendations. Hunt reports serve as the
    formal output of threat hunting activities where analysts proactively search through logs,
    network traffic, endpoint telemetry, and other data sources for evidence of threats that
    have evaded automated detection systems. The report typically includes the hunt hypothesis
    (the specific threat behavior being investigated), the data sources and tools used, the
    queries and analytics performed, any findings or anomalies discovered, newly identified IOCs
    or TTPs, and recommendations for detection rule improvements, security control enhancements,
    or incident response actions.
  why: >-
    Hunt reports are essential for converting proactive threat hunting activities into
    actionable organizational intelligence. They document the evidence chain and methodology
    for any findings that may lead to incident response, create a knowledge base of hunting
    techniques and outcomes that improves future hunt efficiency, identify gaps in automated
    detection that can be closed with new SIEM rules or signatures, and provide management
    visibility into the organization's proactive security posture. Without formalized hunt
    reports, the institutional knowledge gained from hunting activities is lost when analysts
    leave, and recurring threats may be reinvestigated without building on prior work.
  how: >-
    Hunt report generation follows: (1) Hunt planning defines the hypothesis based on threat
    intelligence, MITRE ATT&CK techniques, or anomaly indicators; (2) Analysts query log
    sources including SIEM, EDR, network traffic analysis, and cloud audit logs using structured
    queries and statistical analysis; (3) Findings are documented with evidence including log
    excerpts, timeline reconstructions, and IOC details; (4) Results are classified as true
    positive findings requiring incident response, detection gaps requiring new rules, or
    negative results confirming hypothesis non-occurrence; (5) Recommendations are prioritized
    for detection engineering, security control improvements, and incident response; (6) Reports
    are stored in a hunt management platform or knowledge base for future reference and trend
    analysis; (7) Metrics such as hunt-to-detection ratio and mean time to discovery are tracked.

      value: "A specific, testable statement about threat behavior being investigated, derived from threat intelligence, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, or anomaly indicators."
    - key: "Detection Gap Analysis"
      value: "The process of identifying what automated detection systems missed that the hunt discovered, leading to new SIEM rules, signatures, or detection logic."
    - key: "Hunt-to-Detection Conversion"
      value: "The workflow of converting successful hunt findings into automated detection rules, improving the organization's detection coverage over time."

  embedding_text: >-
    Hunt Report is a structured document produced from proactive threat hunting missions that
    records the hypothesis, methodology, data sources, findings, IOCs, and recommendations.
    Hunt reports convert proactive hunting activities into actionable organizational intelligence
    by documenting evidence chains, identifying detection gaps in automated systems, recommending
    new SIEM rules and Sigma rules, and building institutional knowledge for future hunts.
    Reports classify findings as true positives requiring incident response, detection gaps
    needing new rules, or confirmed negative results. Metrics including hunt-to-detection ratio
    and mean time to discovery track hunting program effectiveness.
