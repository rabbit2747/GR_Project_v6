definition:
  what: >-
    Authentication Event Thresholding is a detection pattern that monitors the rate and volume
    of authentication events within a defined time window to identify anomalous login behavior.
    It establishes baseline thresholds for acceptable authentication attempt frequencies per
    account, source IP, or service, and triggers alerts when those thresholds are exceeded.
    Common threshold configurations include failed login count per minute, successful logins
    from multiple geographies within impossible travel timeframes, and authentication attempts
    against multiple accounts from a single source. This pattern is fundamental to detecting
    brute force attacks, credential stuffing, password spraying, and account enumeration attempts
    across authentication systems including Active Directory, LDAP, RADIUS, OAuth, SAML, and
    cloud identity providers.
  why: >-
    Credential-based attacks remain the most prevalent initial access vector in security
    breaches. Without thresholding on authentication events, brute force and credential stuffing
    attacks can proceed undetected for extended periods. Attackers routinely use automated tools
    to test stolen credential databases against multiple services, and slow-rate attacks can
    evade simple lockout policies. Thresholding provides the detection layer that complements
    preventive controls like account lockout and rate limiting, enabling SOC teams to identify
    and respond to credential attacks in progress before account compromise occurs.
  how: >-
    Authentication event thresholding works by: (1) Collecting authentication logs from identity
    providers, directory services, VPNs, web applications, and cloud platforms into a centralized
    SIEM or log management system; (2) Defining threshold rules based on event counts per time
    window — for example, more than 5 failed logins per account in 10 minutes, or more than 50
    failed logins from a single IP in 5 minutes; (3) Applying sliding window or tumbling window
    aggregation functions to group and count events; (4) Comparing aggregated counts against
    defined thresholds in real-time or near-real-time; (5) Generating alerts with contextual
    metadata including source IP, target accounts, geographic location, and user agent when
    thresholds are breached; (6) Tuning thresholds based on baseline analysis to reduce false
    positives while maintaining detection sensitivity.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Threshold Window"
      value: "The time interval over which authentication events are aggregated for comparison against defined limits, typically ranging from 1 minute to 1 hour depending on the attack type targeted."
    - key: "Sliding vs Tumbling Window"
      value: "Sliding windows evaluate events continuously and can detect attacks spanning window boundaries, while tumbling windows reset at fixed intervals and are simpler to implement but may miss boundary-spanning attacks."
    - key: "Baseline Calibration"
      value: "The process of analyzing historical authentication patterns to establish normal behavior thresholds that minimize false positives while maintaining detection capability for true attacks."

  embedding_text: >-
    Authentication Event Thresholding is a detection pattern that monitors authentication event
    rates within defined time windows to identify brute force, credential stuffing, and password
    spraying attacks. It aggregates failed and successful login events per account, source IP,
    or service using sliding or tumbling windows in SIEM platforms, triggering alerts when counts
    exceed calibrated thresholds. This pattern is essential for detecting credential-based attacks
    across Active Directory, LDAP, OAuth, SAML, and cloud identity providers before account
    compromise occurs. Threshold calibration against baseline authentication behavior is critical
    to balancing detection sensitivity with false positive reduction.
