# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "A normalized file creation event record formatted for ingestion by SIEM and analytics platforms. This event represents the final processed telemetry record after raw file creation signals from multiple sources (EDR agents, Sysmon, OS audit logs) have been normalized, deduplicated, enriched with contextual metadata, and mapped to a common event schema such as OCSF or ECS. The event includes standardized fields for file metadata, actor identity, process context, and classification labels."
  why: "Normalized file creation events enable consistent detection logic across heterogeneous endpoint fleets with different operating systems and EDR products. Standardization eliminates the need for vendor-specific parsing and allows security analysts to write detection rules that work uniformly across all data sources. This is essential for enterprise-scale security operations managing diverse endpoint environments."
  how: "Raw file creation events from EDR agents, Sysmon, and OS audit subsystems are collected by log forwarders, parsed into common schema fields, deduplicated to remove redundant reports from multiple collection layers, enriched with threat intelligence and asset context, and indexed in the SIEM for query and alerting. Detection rules reference normalized field names regardless of the original event source."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Event Schema Normalization"
      value: "The process of mapping diverse vendor-specific event formats to a common schema such as OCSF or Elastic Common Schema for consistent analysis"
    - key: "Event Deduplication"
      value: "Removing redundant event records when multiple collection layers report the same file creation operation"
    - key: "Contextual Enrichment"
      value: "Augmenting raw events with additional metadata including threat intelligence verdicts, asset ownership, and user risk scores"
