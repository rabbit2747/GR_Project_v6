definition:
  what: >-
    An Event Log Delete Event is a detection pattern for the physical deletion of event log
    files from the filesystem, as opposed to clearing log entries through the logging API. This
    includes deletion of Windows .evtx files from C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\, removal of
    syslog files from /var/log/, deletion of systemd journal files, or removal of application
    log files. Detection relies on file integrity monitoring (FIM) systems, Sysmon Event ID 23
    (FileDelete), audit policies tracking file deletion on log directories, and filesystem
    monitoring agents. Unlike log clearing which leaves a clear event record, log file deletion
    may leave no direct log evidence unless external monitoring is in place, making it a more
    stealthy anti-forensics technique.
  why: >-
    Log file deletion is a severe anti-forensics technique that can completely eliminate
    evidence of attacker activity with potentially no trace in the logging system itself. While
    log clearing via the API leaves Event ID 1102, direct file deletion of .evtx files or
    syslog files may leave no log entry if the deletion occurs while the logging service is
    stopped or if the attacker has sufficient privileges to bypass audit policies. This
    technique is used by sophisticated threat actors and ransomware operators who delete logs as
    part of their cleanup phase. Detection of log file deletion is essential for maintaining
    forensic capability and identifying active compromise.
  how: >-
    Event log file deletion is detected through: (1) File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on log
    directories such as C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\ and /var/log/ to detect file removal;
    (2) Sysmon Event ID 23 (FileDelete) configured to monitor log file paths; (3) Windows
    audit policies (Object Access: File System) on log directories to record delete operations;
    (4) EDR agent telemetry that captures file deletion events with process context; (5)
    Monitoring for unexpected stops of the Windows Event Log service (Event ID 7036 for
    EventLog service state changes) which may precede log file deletion; (6) Linux auditd rules
    monitoring unlink and rename syscalls on /var/log/ paths; (7) SIEM correlation detecting
    gaps in expected log flow from monitored systems.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "File Integrity Monitoring"
      value: "FIM systems detect unauthorized changes to or deletion of log files by tracking file hashes, permissions, and existence, providing detection even when the logging system itself is compromised."
    - key: "Sysmon FileDelete"
      value: "Sysmon Event ID 23 captures file deletion events including the process responsible, enabling attribution of log file deletion to specific processes or user accounts."
    - key: "Log Flow Gap Detection"
      value: "SIEM rules that detect unexpected gaps in log event flow from monitored systems, which may indicate log deletion or logging service disruption."
