definition:
  what: >-
    Sigma Correlation Rules are platform-agnostic detection rules written in the Sigma YAML
    format that describe detection logic for security events in a vendor-neutral syntax.
    Created by Florian Roth and Thomas Patzke, Sigma serves as the common language for sharing
    detection logic across different SIEM platforms, similar to how Snort rules standardized
    network-based detection and YARA standardized file-based detection. Sigma rules define log
    source (product, service, category), detection conditions (field matches, wildcards,
    regular expressions, Boolean logic), and metadata (title, description, references, MITRE
    ATT&CK mapping, severity level, false positive guidance). Sigma rules are converted to
    platform-specific query languages using backend converters (sigmac, pySigma) that translate
    Sigma YAML to Splunk SPL, Microsoft Sentinel KQL, Elastic EQL, QRadar AQL, Chronicle YARA-L,
    and dozens of other SIEM and EDR platforms.
  why: >-
    Sigma addresses the critical problem of detection rule portability across heterogeneous
    SIEM environments. Without Sigma, detection rules must be manually rewritten for each SIEM
    platform, creating duplication of effort, inconsistent detection coverage, and difficulty
    sharing detection logic across organizations. The SigmaHQ repository provides thousands of
    community-contributed rules covering MITRE ATT&CK techniques, providing organizations with
    a baseline detection library. Sigma enables detection-as-code practices where rules are
    version-controlled, tested, and deployed through CI/CD pipelines. Threat intelligence
    providers, incident response teams, and security researchers use Sigma as the standard
    format for sharing detection logic in reports and advisories.
  how: >-
    Sigma rule implementation follows: (1) Rule authoring in YAML format specifying title,
    status, description, references, logsource (product, service, category), detection
    conditions (selection, filter, condition), level, tags (MITRE ATT&CK mapping), and false
    positive documentation; (2) Validation against the Sigma specification using sigma-cli
    or pySigma validators; (3) Conversion to target SIEM platform format using pySigma backend
    converters; (4) Testing converted rules against sample data and historical logs to verify
    detection accuracy; (5) Deployment to SIEM platforms through automation pipelines; (6)
    Integration with SigmaHQ community rules for baseline coverage; (7) Correlation rules
    extending basic Sigma by chaining multiple rules with temporal and conditional logic;
    (8) Continuous maintenance including rule updates based on new threat intelligence and
    false positive tuning.

  embedding_text: >-
    Sigma Correlation Rules are platform-agnostic detection rules in YAML format that describe
    security event detection logic independently of any SIEM vendor. Sigma rules specify log
    source, detection conditions, and metadata including MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and are converted
    to platform-specific queries (SPL, KQL, EQL, AQL, YARA-L) via pySigma backend converters.
    SigmaHQ provides thousands of community-contributed rules covering ATT&CK techniques. Sigma
    enables detection-as-code practices with version control, CI/CD deployment, and cross-platform
    portability. Sigma addresses the critical problem of detection rule portability across
    heterogeneous SIEM environments, serving as the standard format for sharing detection logic
    in threat intelligence and incident response contexts.
