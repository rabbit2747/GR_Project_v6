definition:
  what: >-
    SIEM Correlation Rules are the detection logic definitions within Security Information and
    Event Management platforms that analyze, correlate, and evaluate security events from
    multiple sources to identify threats, policy violations, and anomalous behavior. Correlation
    rules range from simple single-event pattern matches (e.g., Event ID 1102 detected) to
    complex multi-event temporal correlations (e.g., 5 failed logins followed by a successful
    login from the same source within 10 minutes). Rule types include threshold rules (event
    count exceeds N in time window T), sequence rules (ordered event patterns), aggregation
    rules (statistical anomaly detection), join rules (correlating events across different log
    sources), and behavioral rules (deviation from established baselines). SIEM platforms such
    as Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, QRadar, Elastic Security, and Chronicle each implement
    correlation rules using platform-specific query languages (SPL, KQL, AQL, EQL, YARA-L).
  why: >-
    SIEM correlation rules are the primary mechanism for converting raw security event data
    into actionable detection alerts. Individual security events in isolation rarely indicate
    attacks — it is the correlation of events across time, sources, and entities that reveals
    attack patterns. Without effective correlation rules, organizations are limited to manual
    log review which cannot scale to modern event volumes (millions of events per day).
    Correlation rules encode security expertise and threat intelligence into automated detection
    logic, enabling 24/7 monitoring without proportional analyst staffing. The quality of
    correlation rules directly determines detection coverage, false positive rates, and mean
    time to detect (MTTD) for security incidents.
  how: >-
    SIEM correlation rule implementation follows: (1) Rule development based on threat
    intelligence, MITRE ATT&CK techniques, regulatory requirements, and organizational risk
    assessment; (2) Rule authoring using platform-specific languages with fields, conditions,
    temporal windows, and aggregation functions; (3) Rule testing against historical data to
    validate detection accuracy and false positive rates; (4) Rule deployment with severity
    classification (critical, high, medium, low, informational); (5) Alert routing to SOC
    analysts with contextual enrichment including affected assets, user context, threat
    intelligence matches, and recommended response actions; (6) Continuous rule tuning based
    on false positive analysis, detection gap assessments, and new threat intelligence; (7)
    Rule lifecycle management including version control, performance monitoring, and
    deprecation of obsolete rules.

  embedding_text: >-
    SIEM Correlation Rules are detection logic definitions within SIEM platforms that analyze and
    correlate security events from multiple sources to identify threats and policy violations.
    Rule types include threshold, sequence, aggregation, join, and behavioral rules implemented
    in platform-specific languages (SPL, KQL, AQL, EQL, YARA-L). Correlation rules convert raw
    security events into actionable alerts by detecting patterns across time, sources, and
    entities. Rule quality directly determines detection coverage, false positive rates, and MTTD.
    The rule lifecycle includes development from MITRE ATT&CK techniques, testing against
    historical data, deployment with severity classification, continuous tuning, and coverage
    matrix maintenance against the ATT&CK framework.
