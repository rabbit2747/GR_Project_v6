# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "A network detection pattern specifically targeting encrypted web traffic (HTTPS) arriving from the internet to organization-hosted web applications and APIs. This pattern combines TLS metadata analysis with web-specific detection logic to identify threats within inbound HTTPS sessions including web application attacks, API abuse, bot activity, and credential stuffing concealed within encrypted web connections on ports 443 and 8443."
  why: "The vast majority of modern web traffic is encrypted with TLS, meaning web application attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF are delivered through HTTPS channels. Without specific monitoring of inbound encrypted web traffic, web application threats bypass network-level inspection entirely. This detection pattern is essential for protecting internet-facing web applications and APIs from attacks that leverage encryption to evade security controls."
  how: "Detection operates at two levels: without decryption, analysis examines TLS handshake metadata, certificate properties, connection patterns, request frequencies, and client fingerprints to identify suspicious behavior; with TLS termination at WAF or reverse proxy, full HTTP content inspection applies web attack signatures, behavioral analytics, bot detection, and rate limiting. Key indicators include unusual request rates from single sources, TLS fingerprints matching known attack tools, connections from Tor exit nodes or anonymizing proxies, and certificate pinning violations."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "HTTPS Inspection"
      value: "Analyzing encrypted web traffic through TLS termination at WAF or reverse proxy to enable full HTTP content inspection."
    - key: "Web Attack Signature Matching"
      value: "Applying known web attack patterns to decrypted HTTPS traffic to detect injection, XSS, and other OWASP Top 10 threats."
    - key: "Bot Detection"
      value: "Identifying automated web requests through behavioral analysis, TLS fingerprinting, and request pattern analysis."
    - key: "Client Fingerprinting"
      value: "Using TLS and HTTP characteristics to fingerprint and classify web clients as legitimate browsers or attack tools."
