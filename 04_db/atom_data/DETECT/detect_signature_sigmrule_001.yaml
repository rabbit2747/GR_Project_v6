definition:
  what: "Sigma rules are an open, vendor-agnostic detection rule format for SIEM systems, analogous to what YARA is for files and Snort/Suricata are for network traffic. Written in YAML, Sigma rules describe log event patterns indicative of malicious activity, misconfigurations, or security-relevant system states. The Sigma project, maintained by the SigmaHQ community, provides both the rule specification and a large repository of community-contributed detection rules covering the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Sigma rules are compiled (converted) into native query languages for specific SIEM platforms including Splunk SPL, Microsoft Sentinel KQL, Elastic Query DSL, QRadar AQL, Chronicle YARA-L, and many others using the pySigma framework and platform-specific backends. The SigmaHQ repository contains thousands of rules organized by log source categories including Windows event logs, Linux auditd, web server logs, cloud platform logs, and application logs."
  why: "Sigma rules solve the critical problem of detection rule portability across SIEM platforms. Without a vendor-neutral format, security teams must rewrite every detection rule when migrating between SIEM platforms, and threat intelligence sharing of detection content is limited to platform-specific formats. Sigma enables the security community to collaboratively develop and share detection content once, then deploy it across any supported SIEM. This dramatically accelerates detection engineering by providing a curated library of community-vetted rules that map to ATT&CK techniques. Organizations using Sigma rules benefit from collective threat intelligence and can maintain consistent detection coverage regardless of their SIEM platform."
  how: "Sigma rules are authored in YAML following the Sigma specification, defining a title, description, log source (product, category, service), detection logic (field conditions with modifiers), false positive documentation, severity level, ATT&CK tags, and metadata. The detection section uses named conditions combined with Boolean logic operators. Rules are compiled to target platforms using pySigma with platform-specific backends that translate Sigma syntax into native queries. Organizations integrate Sigma into their detection engineering pipeline by: maintaining a Sigma rule repository, running automated compilation to their SIEM platform, deploying compiled rules through CI/CD pipelines, validating rules using adversary emulation, and managing rule lifecycle through version control. The SigmaHQ repository serves as the primary community rule source with thousands of peer-reviewed rules."
