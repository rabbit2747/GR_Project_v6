# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "A network detection pattern that identifies periodic or quasi-periodic outbound communication from compromised hosts to command-and-control infrastructure. Beaconing is characterized by regular intervals between connection attempts, consistent payload sizes, and persistent communication with specific external endpoints. Modern malware implements jitter (randomized timing variation) to evade simple periodicity checks, requiring advanced statistical analysis to detect."
  why: "Beaconing is the primary mechanism through which malware and implants maintain communication with command-and-control servers. Detecting beaconing behavior is one of the most effective methods for identifying active compromises, as it reveals persistent adversary presence regardless of the specific malware family or C2 framework in use. Without beaconing detection, compromised hosts can remain under adversary control for extended periods without detection."
  how: "Detection employs statistical analysis of connection timing intervals to identify periodicity, including Fourier transform analysis, standard deviation of inter-arrival times, and entropy calculations. Additional indicators include consistent destination IPs or domains, uniform packet sizes, low data volume per session, connections during off-hours, and communication with uncategorized or newly registered domains. Advanced approaches apply machine learning models trained on known beacon patterns and use jitter-aware algorithms that detect periodicity even with randomized timing."

  embedding_text: "Beaconing detection is a network analysis pattern for identifying periodic or quasi-periodic outbound communications from compromised hosts to command-and-control infrastructure. It uses statistical analysis of connection timing intervals, Fourier transforms, standard deviation calculations, and jitter-aware algorithms to detect regular callback patterns even when malware introduces timing randomization. Key indicators include consistent destination endpoints, uniform payload sizes, low data volume per session, and persistent off-hours communication. Beaconing detection is fundamental to identifying active compromises and revealing adversary persistence within the network."
