definition:
  what: >-
    An Event Log Restart Event is a detection pattern for the sequence of log entries generated
    when an event logging service is stopped and then started again in rapid succession. On
    Windows, this manifests as paired Event ID 7036 entries in the System log showing the
    Windows Event Log service entering the stopped state followed by the running state, or
    Service Control Manager events indicating a restart. On Linux, this corresponds to
    systemd restart events for syslog, rsyslog, syslog-ng, or systemd-journald services.
    The restart sequence creates a brief logging gap during which events are not recorded.
    Restart events are normal during system updates, configuration changes, and maintenance,
    but unexpected restarts outside maintenance windows warrant investigation.
  why: >-
    Event log service restarts create temporary logging blind spots that sophisticated
    attackers may exploit. By forcing a logging service restart, an attacker creates a window
    during which malicious activities — such as credential dumping, lateral movement commands,
    or file access — are not logged. Some attack tools explicitly restart the Event Log service
    as part of their anti-forensics routine. Additionally, frequent unexpected restarts may
    indicate service instability caused by resource exhaustion attacks, log injection attempts
    that crash the service, or configuration tampering. Monitoring restart events enables SOC
    teams to identify and investigate these logging gaps.
  how: >-
    Event log restart detection operates through: (1) Monitoring Windows System log for paired
    Event ID 7036 entries for the Windows Event Log service showing stop followed by start
    within a short time window; (2) Detecting Event ID 7034 (service crashed unexpectedly)
    followed by automatic restart; (3) Monitoring for net stop/net start or sc stop/sc start
    commands targeting the EventLog service via process creation logging; (4) Tracking PowerShell
    Restart-Service commands for logging services; (5) On Linux, monitoring systemd journal for
    restart events on syslog and audit services; (6) SIEM correlation rules that detect logging
    gaps by measuring time between the last event before restart and the first event after;
    (7) Alerting on restarts outside scheduled maintenance windows.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Logging Gap Window"
      value: "The time period between service stop and start during which events are not recorded, representing a potential blind spot that attackers may exploit for unlogged activities."
    - key: "Service Crash and Restart"
      value: "Unexpected service crashes followed by automatic restart may indicate denial-of-service attacks against the logging infrastructure or attempts to trigger log rotation."
    - key: "Maintenance Window Correlation"
      value: "Correlating restart events with approved maintenance windows distinguishes legitimate administrative restarts from suspicious unauthorized restarts."

  embedding_text: >-
    Event Log Restart Event is a detection pattern for the stop-then-start sequence of logging
    services. On Windows, this manifests as paired Event ID 7036 entries for the EventLog
    service; on Linux, as systemd restart events for syslog or audit services. Restarts create
    temporary logging blind spots that attackers may exploit for unlogged malicious activities.
    Detection relies on monitoring service state change events, process creation logs for
    restart commands, SIEM gap detection between pre-restart and post-restart events, and
    correlation with maintenance windows. Unexpected restarts outside maintenance windows
    warrant investigation as potential defense evasion activity under MITRE ATT&CK T1562.002.
