definition:
  what: "Web Session Activity Analysis is a behavioral detection technique that monitors and profiles user interactions within authenticated web sessions to identify anomalous, malicious, or compromised activity. The analysis examines session-level telemetry including page navigation sequences, request frequency and timing patterns, data volume transferred per session, API call patterns, form submission behavior, session duration and idle patterns, concurrent session counts, and cookie or token manipulation. By establishing baselines of normal session behavior per user, role, and application, the technique detects deviations that indicate session hijacking, credential theft, automated bot activity, account takeover, or insider data exfiltration. Detection operates across both traditional server-rendered web applications and modern single-page applications that communicate primarily through API calls."
  why: "Web sessions represent the primary interaction surface between users and business-critical applications, making them a high-value target for attackers. Session hijacking through stolen cookies or tokens allows attackers to bypass authentication entirely and operate with the victim's privileges. Credential stuffing and account takeover attacks manifest as sessions with abnormal behavioral characteristics compared to the legitimate account holder. Automated tools and bots used for scraping, fraud, and vulnerability scanning produce distinctive session patterns that differ from human interaction. Insider threats often appear as sessions with unusual data access volumes, abnormal navigation to sensitive resources, or activity outside established behavioral norms. Detecting these anomalies at the session level provides a critical security layer that operates independently of network-level and endpoint-level controls, catching threats that authenticate successfully but behave maliciously."
  how: "Session activity analysis ingests telemetry from web application firewalls, reverse proxies, application server logs, and client-side instrumentation. Per-session feature extraction computes behavioral metrics including request rate and inter-request timing distributions, navigation graph patterns showing page traversal sequences, data transfer volumes by direction and content type, API endpoint access patterns and parameter distributions, and mouse movement or keystroke dynamics when available from client-side telemetry. Machine learning models trained on historical session data establish per-user and per-role behavioral baselines. Real-time scoring compares active sessions against these baselines, flagging statistical outliers across multiple dimensions simultaneously. Session fingerprinting techniques detect token replay and session fixation by correlating session tokens with device fingerprints, TLS characteristics, and source network properties. Automated response capabilities include session termination for high-confidence threats, step-up authentication challenges for moderate anomalies, and enhanced logging for low-confidence deviations. Integration with SIEM platforms enables correlation of session anomalies with other security events such as concurrent login alerts, geographic anomalies, and endpoint compromise indicators."
