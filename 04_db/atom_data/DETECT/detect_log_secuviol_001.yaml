definition:
  what: >-
    A Security Violation is a detection log event pattern that records any action or condition
    that violates an organization's defined security policies, compliance requirements, or
    security baselines. Security violations encompass a broad spectrum including unauthorized
    access attempts (accessing resources beyond granted permissions), policy non-compliance
    (disabled endpoint protection, unencrypted data transmission, unauthorized software
    installation), configuration drift from security baselines (hardening standard deviations,
    firewall rule changes), behavioral anomalies (data exfiltration patterns, impossible travel,
    off-hours access), and regulatory compliance breaches (PCI DSS scope violations, HIPAA
    data handling violations, GDPR consent violations). Security violations are generated by
    diverse sources including firewalls, IDS/IPS, DLP systems, endpoint protection platforms,
    identity management systems, and SIEM correlation rules.
  why: >-
    Security violation detection is the primary mechanism for identifying threats that bypass
    preventive controls and policy enforcement gaps. Not all threats are detected by signatures
    or known attack patterns — violations of security policies often indicate novel attack
    techniques, insider threats, or misconfigured systems that create exploitable weaknesses.
    Continuous monitoring for security violations supports compliance requirements across
    PCI DSS (Requirement 10), HIPAA (Security Rule), SOX (Section 404), and GDPR (Article 32).
    Undetected security violations accumulate into systemic weaknesses that attackers discover
    and exploit during advanced persistent threat campaigns.
  how: >-
    Security violation detection operates through: (1) Policy-based detection rules in SIEM
    platforms that evaluate security events against defined security policies and baselines;
    (2) IDS/IPS systems generating violation alerts for network-based policy infractions;
    (3) DLP systems detecting unauthorized data handling or exfiltration attempts; (4) Endpoint
    protection platforms reporting policy non-compliance such as disabled agents or unsigned
    code execution; (5) Identity management systems flagging unauthorized access attempts and
    privilege misuse; (6) Configuration management tools detecting drift from security baselines;
    (7) UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics) identifying behavioral anomalies that
    constitute policy violations; (8) Automated classification of violations by severity,
    category, and required response action; (9) Escalation workflows routing violations to
    appropriate response teams based on type and severity.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Policy-Based Detection"
      value: "Detection rules derived from organizational security policies that translate human-readable policy statements into machine-evaluable conditions applied to security event data."
    - key: "Violation Severity Classification"
      value: "A tiered classification system (critical, high, medium, low, informational) that determines the urgency and type of response required for each security violation."
    - key: "Compliance Mapping"
      value: "The linkage between security violation types and specific regulatory requirements, enabling compliance reporting and gap analysis."

  embedding_text: >-
    Security Violation is a detection log event pattern for actions or conditions that violate
    organizational security policies, compliance requirements, or security baselines. Violations
    span unauthorized access attempts, policy non-compliance, configuration drift, behavioral
    anomalies, and regulatory breaches. Generated by firewalls, IDS/IPS, DLP, endpoint protection,
    identity management, and SIEM correlation rules, security violations are the primary mechanism
    for identifying threats beyond preventive controls. Violations support compliance monitoring
    for PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, and GDPR. Detection relies on policy-based SIEM rules, IDS/IPS
    alerts, DLP systems, UEBA behavioral analytics, and configuration drift monitoring with
    severity-based classification and escalation workflows.
