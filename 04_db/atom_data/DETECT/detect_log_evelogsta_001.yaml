definition:
  what: >-
    An Event Log Start Event is a detection pattern for log entries generated when an event
    logging service or log channel begins recording events. On Windows, this is recorded as
    Event ID 6005 in the System log (The Event log service was started), Event ID 7036 showing
    the Windows Event Log service entering the running state, and channel-specific initialization
    events. On Linux, this corresponds to systemd service start events for syslog, rsyslog,
    syslog-ng, or systemd-journald, as well as auditd service start messages. The start event
    marks the beginning of the logging timeline and is the first event recorded after system
    boot, service restart, or recovery from a logging disruption. It establishes the baseline
    timestamp from which all subsequent events are referenced.
  why: >-
    Event log start events are critical for establishing logging continuity and identifying
    gaps in the audit trail. The timestamp of the start event, compared with the last event
    before a stop or system shutdown, reveals the duration of any logging gap during which
    security events were not recorded. Unexpected start events outside of system boot sequences
    or scheduled maintenance may indicate that the logging service was previously stopped or
    disabled by an attacker and has been restored, either by the attacker covering tracks or
    by automated recovery mechanisms. Start events also confirm that logging is operational
    after system deployment, patch installation, or incident recovery.
  how: >-
    Event log start event detection operates through: (1) Monitoring Windows System log for
    Event ID 6005 (Event log service started) which occurs at every system boot; (2) Tracking
    Event ID 7036 for the EventLog service entering the running state; (3) Correlating start
    events with prior stop events to calculate logging gap duration; (4) Alerting on start
    events that are not preceded by a normal system boot sequence (Event ID 6009/6013) which
    may indicate a service restart; (5) On Linux, monitoring systemd journal for service start
    entries for logging daemons; (6) SIEM rules that validate logging timeline continuity by
    comparing the start event timestamp with the expected boot time or maintenance schedule;
    (7) Automated health checks that verify logging service status across managed endpoints.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Logging Timeline Baseline"
      value: "The start event timestamp establishes the beginning of the logging timeline, with any gap between the previous stop event and this start representing unmonitored time."
    - key: "Boot vs Service Restart"
      value: "Distinguishing between start events caused by normal system boot and those caused by isolated service restarts is critical for identifying potential logging disruption attacks."
    - key: "Post-Incident Logging Verification"
      value: "After incident response or recovery operations, start events confirm that logging has been properly restored and is capturing events for ongoing monitoring."

  embedding_text: >-
    Event Log Start Event is a detection pattern for log entries generated when event logging
    services begin recording. On Windows, Event ID 6005 (Event log service was started) and
    Event ID 7036 (service running state) mark logging initialization. On Linux, systemd
    service start events for syslog and auditd serve the same purpose. Start events establish
    the logging timeline baseline, and gap analysis between previous stop events and start
    events reveals unmonitored periods. Unexpected start events outside boot sequences or
    maintenance windows may indicate recovery from attacker-caused logging disruption.
    Detection relies on event correlation, boot sequence validation, and SIEM timeline
    continuity checks.
