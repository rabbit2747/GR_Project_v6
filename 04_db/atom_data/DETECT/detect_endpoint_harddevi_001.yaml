definition:
  what: "Hardware Device Event is a comprehensive endpoint detection pattern that serves as the parent category for all hardware device lifecycle events on an endpoint system. It encompasses device connection, disconnection, binding, unbinding, enabling, disabling, state changes, moves, and updates across all device types including USB, PCI, Thunderbolt, Bluetooth, and virtual devices. This pattern provides a unified view of all hardware-related activity on the system, aggregating telemetry from multiple OS subsystems into a coherent device activity timeline."
  why: "Comprehensive hardware device monitoring is essential because adversaries use hardware-based attack vectors at multiple stages of the attack lifecycle. Hardware additions provide initial access, driver manipulation enables privilege escalation, device state changes facilitate defense evasion, and removable media enables exfiltration. A unified hardware event monitoring framework ensures no device activity falls through detection gaps and enables correlation across device lifecycle events that individually may appear benign but together reveal malicious patterns such as a new device connection followed by driver binding, data access, and rapid disconnection."
  how: "The hardware device event framework aggregates telemetry from multiple OS sources including Windows WMI and ETW providers for Plug and Play events, Linux udev subsystem and kernel device model events, macOS IOKit framework notifications, and BIOS/UEFI device enumeration data. The unified event stream is processed through correlation engines that link related device lifecycle events, maintain device session timelines, track device state machines, and apply behavioral analytics to identify anomalous device usage patterns. Machine learning models establish baseline device activity per user and workstation to detect deviations."
