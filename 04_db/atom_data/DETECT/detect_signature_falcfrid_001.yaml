definition:
  what: "Falcon Friday is a community-driven collection of detection rules and hunting queries published by FalconForce, a Dutch cybersecurity firm. The project releases weekly detection content primarily written in Kusto Query Language (KQL) for Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Each Falcon Friday release focuses on a specific adversary technique, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, and provides a detection rule along with detailed explanations of the attack technique, detection logic, false positive considerations, and testing guidance. The collection covers techniques across the full ATT&CK matrix including initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, lateral movement, and command and control."
  why: "Falcon Friday addresses the gap between theoretical threat knowledge and practical detection implementation. Many organizations struggle to convert MITRE ATT&CK technique descriptions into actionable detection rules for their SIEM or EDR platforms. By providing production-ready KQL queries with thorough documentation, Falcon Friday enables security teams to rapidly deploy detections for specific adversary techniques without starting from scratch. The project also serves as an educational resource, helping analysts understand the relationship between attack mechanics and detection logic."
  how: "Each Falcon Friday rule is developed by analyzing a specific ATT&CK technique, identifying observable artifacts in telemetry sources (process creation logs, registry events, network connections, authentication logs), and crafting KQL queries that detect those artifacts while minimizing false positives. The rules are designed for deployment in Microsoft Sentinel workspaces or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint advanced hunting. Organizations adopt Falcon Friday by importing the KQL queries into their SIEM, customizing thresholds and exclusions for their environment, validating the rules using adversary emulation tools, and integrating them into their detection engineering workflow. The rules are versioned and maintained in a public GitHub repository."
