definition:
  what: "Scheduled Job Event is a comprehensive endpoint detection pattern that serves as the parent category for all scheduled task lifecycle events across operating systems. It encompasses the complete lifecycle of scheduled jobs including creation, modification, deletion, enabling, disabling, starting, completion, and failure events for Windows Task Scheduler tasks, Linux cron jobs, systemd timers, at jobs, and macOS launchd agents and daemons. This unified pattern provides holistic visibility into all scheduled execution mechanisms on endpoints, enabling correlation across lifecycle phases to detect sophisticated attack patterns that span multiple events."
  why: "Scheduled task manipulation is among the most prevalent adversary techniques for persistence, execution, and privilege escalation, documented extensively in MITRE ATT&CK T1053. A comprehensive view of the complete scheduled job lifecycle is necessary because adversaries often combine multiple operations such as creating a disabled task, modifying its trigger, enabling it at a specific time, and deleting it after execution to evade detection systems that only monitor individual event types. The parent scheduled job event pattern ensures no phase of task manipulation escapes detection and enables behavioral analysis across the full task lifecycle."
  how: "The scheduled job event framework aggregates telemetry from Windows Task Scheduler events (Event IDs 4698-4702 and operational log events), Linux auditd rules for crontab operations, systemd timer unit management events, at daemon logs, and macOS launchd configuration changes. The unified event stream maintains per-task lifecycle state machines that track each task from creation through all state changes to deletion. Correlation engines identify suspicious patterns such as rapid create-execute-delete cycles, tasks that are created and immediately disabled for later activation, modifications to existing legitimate tasks to insert malicious commands, and scheduled tasks that consistently fail suggesting reconnaissance or testing by adversaries."
