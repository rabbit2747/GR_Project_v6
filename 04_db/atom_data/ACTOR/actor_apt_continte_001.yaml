# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Contagious Interview is a North Korean APT campaign, a subgroup within the Lazarus Group ecosystem, that lures software developers and IT professionals through fake job interviews. Active since at least 2023, the group poses as recruiters on platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub, instructing victims to download and run malicious npm packages or coding challenges that install the BeaverTail infostealer and InvisibleFerret backdoor on their systems. The campaign targets developers working in cryptocurrency, fintech, and technology sectors."
  why: "Contagious Interview represents an evolution in North Korean cyber operations, exploiting the trust inherent in job recruitment processes to compromise individual developers. Successful compromises provide access to cryptocurrency wallets, source code repositories, and corporate credentials. This campaign runs in parallel with North Korea's IT worker infiltration scheme and collectively represents a major threat to the technology and cryptocurrency sectors."
  how: "Operators create fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn, GitHub, and freelance platforms. Targets are invited to fake job interviews and asked to complete coding challenges by cloning GitHub repositories containing trojanized npm packages. The BeaverTail malware, written in JavaScript, steals browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, and credentials. InvisibleFerret, a Python-based backdoor, provides persistent remote access with keylogging, clipboard monitoring, and file exfiltration capabilities. The campaign targets Windows, macOS, and Linux systems."
