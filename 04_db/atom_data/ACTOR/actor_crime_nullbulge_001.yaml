definition:
  what: >-
    NullBulge is a cybercriminal group that emerged in 2024, claiming to be motivated by protecting
    artists and opposing the use of artificial intelligence in creative industries. The group gained
    significant attention for their July 2024 breach of the Walt Disney Company's internal Slack
    workspace, where they exfiltrated and leaked over 1.1 terabytes of data including internal
    communications, unreleased project details, source code, API credentials, and confidential
    business information from approximately 10,000 Slack channels. NullBulge also conducts supply
    chain attacks by distributing malicious code through popular open-source platforms including
    GitHub repositories and modding communities, poisoning AI/ML training datasets and tools, and
    deploying information-stealing malware through trojanized software targeting AI developers
    and creative professionals.
  why: >-
    NullBulge represents an emerging threat actor archetype that combines ideological motivations
    (anti-AI activism) with traditional cybercriminal techniques. The Disney Slack breach
    demonstrated the catastrophic potential of compromising enterprise collaboration platforms,
    where a single insider credential or compromised account can expose vast amounts of
    organizational data across thousands of channels. The group's supply chain attack tactics,
    targeting AI/ML repositories and developer tools, pose risks to the integrity of AI training
    data and development pipelines. A US individual, Ryan Mitchell Kramer, was charged by the
    FBI in connection with the NullBulge Disney breach, with the criminal complaint revealing
    the use of a malicious Python package that contained AsyncRAT to compromise a Disney
    employee's credentials.
  how: >-
    NullBulge uses multiple attack vectors. For the Disney breach, the group compromised a Disney
    employee through a trojanized Python tool distributed via GitHub that contained the AsyncRAT
    remote access trojan, which harvested credentials including the employee's Slack authentication
    tokens. With access to the Disney internal Slack workspace, the group exfiltrated data from
    approximately 10,000 channels over a period of time before announcing the breach publicly.
    Supply chain attacks involve publishing malicious code packages on GitHub, PyPI, and modding
    platforms (including BeamNG.drive and Cities: Skylines modding communities) that contain
    information-stealing malware. The group also targets AI/ML practitioners by distributing
    poisoned datasets, malicious Jupyter notebooks, and trojanized AI model files. NullBulge
    uses Telegram and dark web forums to publish stolen data and recruit collaborators.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Enterprise Collaboration Platform Compromise"
      value: >-
        The Disney Slack breach demonstrated that compromising enterprise collaboration platforms
        like Slack provides access to vast amounts of organizational data, as these platforms
        aggregate communications, files, and credentials across thousands of channels and teams.
    - key: "AI/ML Supply Chain Poisoning"
      value: >-
        NullBulge targets the AI development ecosystem through trojanized tools, poisoned datasets,
        and malicious code packages distributed through popular repositories, representing an
        emerging threat to AI/ML development pipeline integrity.
