# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Rhino Security Labs is a penetration testing and security research firm specializing in cloud security, particularly AWS environments. The company is known for developing Pacu, an open-source AWS exploitation framework used for cloud penetration testing and security assessments. Rhino Security Labs provides penetration testing, cloud security assessments, and red team services with deep expertise in cloud-native attack techniques and misconfigurations."
  why: "Rhino Security Labs is significant in cybersecurity because their AWS-focused research and the Pacu exploitation framework have defined how the industry approaches cloud penetration testing. As organizations migrate to cloud infrastructure, understanding cloud-specific attack techniques and misconfigurations is essential. Rhino's research on AWS privilege escalation, IAM misconfiguration exploitation, and cloud attack paths directly informs defensive cloud security strategies."
  how: "Rhino Security Labs conducts cloud penetration testing by identifying and exploiting misconfigurations in AWS IAM policies, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, EC2 instances, and other cloud services. Pacu provides automated enumeration, privilege escalation, and exploitation modules for AWS environments. The company publishes detailed research on cloud attack techniques through their blog, presents at security conferences, and maintains open-source tools on GitHub for cloud security assessment."
