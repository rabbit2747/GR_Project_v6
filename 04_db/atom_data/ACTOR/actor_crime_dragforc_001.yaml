# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    DragonForce is a cybercriminal and hacktivist threat group that originated in Malaysia and has
    evolved from primarily hacktivist operations into a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation.
    Initially known for pro-Palestinian hacktivism and defacement campaigns, the group expanded its
    operations in 2023-2024 to include ransomware attacks and data extortion against organizations
    globally. DragonForce developed custom ransomware based on leaked LockBit 3.0 (LockBit Black)
    source code and a variant based on leaked Conti source code, operating a double-extortion model
    with a Tor-based leak site. The group has targeted organizations in the United States, United
    Kingdom, Australia, Israel, India, and Singapore across sectors including retail, manufacturing,
    healthcare, and government.
  why: >-
    DragonForce exemplifies the convergence of hacktivism and financially motivated cybercrime,
    demonstrating how hacktivist groups can leverage leaked ransomware source code to pivot into
    profitable extortion operations. Their use of leaked LockBit 3.0 and Conti source code to
    develop custom ransomware variants highlights the ongoing impact of ransomware source code
    leaks on the threat landscape. The group's 2025 attacks on major UK retailers including Marks
    and Spencer, Harrods, and the Co-operative Group demonstrated their capability to disrupt
    significant commercial operations. DragonForce also launched a RaaS affiliate program,
    expanding the potential reach of their ransomware through criminal partnerships.
  how: >-
    DragonForce gains initial access through exploitation of internet-facing vulnerabilities,
    compromised credentials, and phishing campaigns. The group exploits known vulnerabilities
    including Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228), Fortinet FortiOS vulnerabilities, and Microsoft
    Exchange flaws. Post-compromise, the group uses Cobalt Strike, SystemBC, and legitimate
    remote access tools for command and control. Data exfiltration is performed using custom
    tools and cloud storage services before ransomware deployment. The ransomware variants,
    based on leaked LockBit Black and Conti code, encrypt files across Windows and Linux systems
    including VMware ESXi. Earlier hacktivist operations included web defacement, DDoS attacks,
    and database dumping against Israeli and Indian targets. The group operates a Tor-based
    leak site for publishing stolen data and manages a RaaS affiliate program.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Hacktivist to RaaS Evolution"
      value: >-
        DragonForce evolved from a primarily hacktivist group conducting defacement and DDoS
        attacks into a full ransomware-as-a-service operation, demonstrating the pipeline from
        ideologically motivated hacking to financially motivated cybercrime.
    - key: "Leaked Source Code Weaponization"
      value: >-
        The group built custom ransomware variants from leaked LockBit 3.0 and Conti source code,
        demonstrating how ransomware source code leaks enable new threat actors to rapidly develop
        sophisticated encryption tools.
