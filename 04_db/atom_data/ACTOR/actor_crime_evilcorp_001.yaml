# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Evil Corp (also tracked as Indrik Spider and Gold Drake) is one of the most prolific and
    long-running Russian-based cybercriminal organizations, active since at least 2007. The group
    is led by Maksim Yakubets (known as "aqua") and Igor Turashev, who were indicted by the US
    Department of Justice in December 2019 and sanctioned by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign
    Assets Control (OFAC). Evil Corp is responsible for the development and deployment of the Dridex
    banking trojan (evolved from Bugat/Cridex), which caused over $100 million in financial losses
    globally. The group later transitioned to ransomware operations developing WastedLocker, Hades,
    Phoenix Locker, PayloadBIN, Macaw Locker, and leveraging LockBit ransomware to circumvent
    sanctions. Evil Corp has been linked to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) through
    Yakubets' alleged work for the agency.
  why: >-
    Evil Corp represents a critical nexus between Russian organized cybercrime and state intelligence
    services. Yakubets was identified by the US Treasury as having been tasked to work for the FSB
    as of 2017, demonstrating the Russian government's exploitation of cybercriminal talent. OFAC
    sanctions against Evil Corp created unprecedented challenges for the ransomware ecosystem, as
    paying ransoms to sanctioned entities exposes victims and insurers to legal liability. This
    forced Evil Corp to repeatedly rebrand their ransomware to disguise their involvement and
    eventually affiliate with LockBit to distance payments from sanctions. The group's $5 million
    reward under the US State Department's Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program underscores
    their significance. Evil Corp's operational history spanning banking trojans to ransomware
    illustrates the complete evolution of financially motivated cybercrime over nearly two decades.
  how: >-
    Evil Corp's operations evolved through distinct phases. The Dridex era (2014-2019) involved
    massive spam campaigns distributing the Dridex banking trojan via malicious Office documents to
    steal banking credentials and conduct wire fraud. The ransomware era (2020-present) began with
    WastedLocker, which used CobaltStrike beacons delivered through the SocGholish (FakeUpdates)
    JavaScript-based malware framework that compromises legitimate websites. Post-compromise, the
    group uses Cobalt Strike, PowerShell Empire, and custom tooling for lateral movement and
    privilege escalation. WastedLocker and successor ransomware variants targeted high-value
    organizations with demands ranging from $500,000 to $10 million+. To evade sanctions-related
    scrutiny, Evil Corp cycled through multiple ransomware brands (Hades, Phoenix, PayloadBIN,
    Macaw) and eventually became LockBit affiliates. The group targets enterprise environments,
    exploiting Active Directory infrastructure for domain-wide encryption.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Sanctions Evasion Through Rebranding"
      value: >-
        After OFAC sanctions in 2019, Evil Corp repeatedly rebranded their ransomware operations
        (WastedLocker to Hades to Phoenix to Macaw to LockBit affiliation) to disguise their
        involvement and enable victims to pay ransoms without sanctions liability.
    - key: "State-Crime Nexus"
      value: >-
        Evil Corp represents the nexus between Russian organized cybercrime and state intelligence,
        with leader Yakubets identified as working for the FSB, demonstrating how the Russian
        government leverages cybercriminal groups for strategic purposes.

    Evil Corp represents the complete evolution of financially motivated cybercrime from banking

    Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program. Their sanctions evasion through repeated
    rebranding created unprecedented challenges for the ransomware payment ecosystem.
