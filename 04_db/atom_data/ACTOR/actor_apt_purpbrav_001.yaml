# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Purple Bravo (also tracked as TAG-110, Insekt Group, and UAC-0063) is a Russia-aligned cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2021, targeting government entities, diplomatic missions, research institutions, and educational organizations primarily in Central Asia, East Asia, and Europe. The group has strong infrastructure and tooling overlaps with APT28/Fancy Bear operations, suggesting it operates within or alongside Russian military intelligence."
  why: "The group conducts espionage operations aligned with Russian intelligence interests in Central Asian nations, monitoring political developments, diplomatic relationships, and educational/research activities in former Soviet states and nations of strategic importance. Targeting patterns suggest focus on understanding regional geopolitics, NATO expansion dynamics, and maintaining influence in Russia's traditional sphere of influence."
  how: "Purple Bravo deploys custom malware families including HatVibe and CherrySpy through spear-phishing campaigns with document lures relevant to government and diplomatic topics. HatVibe is an HTML Application-based loader that establishes persistence through scheduled tasks, while CherrySpy is a Python-based backdoor for data collection and exfiltration. The group uses legitimate web services for C2 and employs multi-stage infection chains. Operations have been observed using compromised government email accounts for lateral phishing to increase credibility."
