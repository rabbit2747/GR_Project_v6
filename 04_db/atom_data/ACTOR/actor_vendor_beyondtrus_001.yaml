# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "BeyondTrust is a cybersecurity vendor specializing in privileged access management (PAM), identity security, and endpoint privilege management. The company provides solutions including Password Safe (privileged credential vaulting), Privilege Management (endpoint least privilege enforcement), and Privileged Remote Access (secure vendor and remote access). BeyondTrust enables organizations to control, monitor, and audit all privileged access across their environments."
  why: "BeyondTrust is significant because privileged account compromise is one of the most common and damaging attack vectors in enterprise breaches. Their PAM solutions address the critical security need to control and monitor administrative access, enforce least privilege principles, and secure remote access for IT staff and third-party vendors. Privileged access management is consistently identified as a top security control by major frameworks."
  how: "BeyondTrust operates through an integrated PAM platform that discovers and vaults privileged credentials, enforces least privilege on endpoints by elevating applications rather than users, provides secure remote access with session recording, and monitors privileged sessions for anomalous behavior. The platform integrates with SIEM, ITSM, and identity governance solutions to provide comprehensive privileged access lifecycle management."
