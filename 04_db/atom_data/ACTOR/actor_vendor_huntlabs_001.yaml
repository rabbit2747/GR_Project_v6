# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Huntress is a managed security platform focused on protecting small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) and managed service providers (MSPs). The company provides managed endpoint detection and response (EDR), managed SIEM, security awareness training, and a 24/7 Security Operations Center. Huntress is known for its threat research team that actively tracks and reports on emerging threats targeting the MSP ecosystem, ransomware campaigns, and supply chain attacks."
  why: "Huntress is significant in cybersecurity because it fills a critical gap in providing enterprise-grade detection and response capabilities to the SMB and MSP market, which is disproportionately targeted by ransomware and commodity malware. Their threat research team regularly publishes timely analysis of active campaigns, making them a valuable source of operational threat intelligence for the broader security community."
  how: "Huntress deploys lightweight agents on endpoints that monitor for indicators of compromise, persistence mechanisms, and malicious activity. Their platform combines automated detection with human-driven threat hunting by a 24/7 SOC team. When threats are identified, Huntress provides actionable remediation guidance and can initiate automated response actions. The company publishes regular threat advisories and blog posts documenting emerging attack campaigns targeting their customer base."

The company operates a 24/7 Security Operations Center staffed by threat hunters who actively monitor customer environments for indicators of compromise, persistence mechanisms, and malicious activity. Huntress is widely recognized for its threat research team that regularly publishes detailed analysis of ransomware campaigns, supply chain attacks, and emerging threats targeting the MSP ecosystem. The platform deploys lightweight endpoint agents combined with human-driven threat hunting to provide enterprise-grade detection and response capabilities to organizations that typically lack dedicated security teams. Huntress fills a critical market gap by bringing advanced security operations to the SMB segment, which is disproportionately targeted by commodity malware and ransomware operators."
