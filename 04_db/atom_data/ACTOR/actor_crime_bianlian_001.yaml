# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    BianLian is a cybercriminal extortion group that emerged in mid-2022 initially operating as a
    double-extortion ransomware operation deploying custom Go-based ransomware. Following the release
    of a free decryptor by Avast in January 2023, the group pivoted to a pure data exfiltration and
    extortion model, abandoning file encryption entirely. BianLian targets critical infrastructure
    sectors including healthcare, financial services, education, manufacturing, professional services,
    and government organizations primarily in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
    The group is known for exploiting external-facing applications such as RDP, VPN, and ProxyShell
    vulnerabilities for initial access, then establishing persistence through implanted web shells,
    custom backdoors, and legitimate remote access tools.
  why: >-
    BianLian represents an evolving threat model in the ransomware ecosystem, demonstrating that
    cybercriminal groups can successfully monetize stolen data without encrypting victim systems.
    Their pivot to exfiltration-only operations in 2023 reduced their operational complexity while
    maintaining revenue through extortion. The group's targeting of healthcare and critical
    infrastructure organizations poses significant risks to public safety and data privacy. A joint
    CISA, FBI, and ACSC advisory (AA23-136A) was issued specifically for BianLian, underscoring the
    threat level. Their use of legitimate tools like AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and SplashTop for
    persistence makes detection particularly challenging for defenders.
  how: >-
    BianLian gains initial access primarily through compromised RDP credentials, exploitation of
    known vulnerabilities in VPN appliances and Microsoft Exchange (ProxyShell), and phishing
    campaigns. Post-compromise, the group deploys custom backdoors written in Go, uses living-off-the-land
    techniques including PowerShell, WMI, and cmd.exe for discovery, and leverages legitimate remote
    management tools (AnyDesk, TeamViewer, Atera, SplashTop) for persistent access. For credential
    harvesting, they use tools including Mimikatz, LaZagne, and credential dumping from LSASS. Data
    exfiltration is conducted using Rclone, Mega, and custom scripts to cloud storage. The group
    operates a Tor-based leak site where they publish stolen data from non-paying victims.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Exfiltration-Only Extortion"
      value: >-
        BianLian's post-2023 model focuses exclusively on stealing sensitive data and threatening
        public disclosure rather than encrypting files, representing a strategic shift in the
        ransomware-as-extortion landscape.
    - key: "Go-Based Tooling"
      value: >-
        The group develops custom malware and backdoors in the Go programming language, enabling
        cross-platform targeting of both Windows and Linux systems with compiled static binaries.
