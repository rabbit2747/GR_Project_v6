# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Amazon Technologies, primarily through Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the world's largest cloud computing platform provider, offering over 200 services spanning compute, storage, networking, databases, AI/ML, and security. AWS provides foundational cloud infrastructure used by millions of organizations and includes a comprehensive suite of security services such as GuardDuty (threat detection), Security Hub (security posture management), WAF, Shield (DDoS protection), IAM, KMS, and CloudTrail (audit logging)."
  why: "Amazon Technologies through AWS is a critical actor in the cybersecurity landscape because it serves as the infrastructure backbone for a significant portion of the internet. AWS security services set industry standards for cloud security, and AWS infrastructure is both a target for threat actors and a platform upon which defensive capabilities are built. Understanding AWS security is essential for any modern security program."
  how: "AWS delivers security through a shared responsibility model where AWS secures the cloud infrastructure while customers secure their workloads within it. AWS provides native security services including threat detection (GuardDuty), security posture management (Security Hub), identity management (IAM), encryption (KMS), network security (Security Groups, NACLs, WAF), DDoS protection (Shield), and comprehensive audit logging (CloudTrail). AWS also publishes security bulletins and threat research."
