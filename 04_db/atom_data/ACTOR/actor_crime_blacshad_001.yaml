# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Black Shadow is an Iranian-linked cybercriminal and hacktivist group that emerged in 2020 and
    is known for conducting high-profile data breach and extortion attacks primarily against Israeli
    organizations. The group has targeted Israeli insurance companies, internet hosting providers,
    LGBTQ+ dating platforms, medical facilities, and technology companies, exfiltrating and leaking
    sensitive personal data including medical records, financial information, and user credentials.
    Notable attacks include the October 2021 breach of CyberServe (an Israeli hosting company) that
    exposed data from the Atraf LGBTQ+ dating app, the December 2020 attack on Shirbit insurance
    company, and breaches of KLS Capital and other Israeli financial entities. Black Shadow combines
    financial extortion motives with ideological objectives aligned with Iranian geopolitical
    interests against Israel.
  why: >-
    Black Shadow represents a significant threat to Israeli critical infrastructure and civilian
    data privacy, operating at the intersection of cybercrime and state-aligned hacktivism. The
    group's deliberate targeting of sensitive personal data, including LGBTQ+ dating profiles and
    medical records in a region where such exposure can have severe personal consequences,
    demonstrates a willingness to weaponize data for maximum psychological and social impact.
    Their attacks have caused substantial economic damage and public fear, with the Shirbit breach
    alone resulting in ransom demands of approximately 50 Bitcoin. The group's suspected alignment
    with Iranian state interests, potentially operating as a front for or alongside Iranian
    intelligence, places them within the broader context of Iran-Israel cyber conflict.
  how: >-
    Black Shadow gains initial access through exploitation of vulnerabilities in internet-facing
    web applications, cloud hosting infrastructure, and enterprise VPN systems. The group
    specifically targets Israeli hosting providers and cloud service companies to gain access to
    multiple downstream customer organizations through a single compromise. Post-compromise
    activities include large-scale data exfiltration of customer databases, personal records, and
    sensitive files. The group uses Telegram channels and dark web forums to announce breaches,
    publish stolen data, and issue ransom demands. When victims refuse to pay, Black Shadow
    progressively leaks increasingly sensitive data to maximize pressure. The group has demonstrated
    the ability to compromise and extract data from production databases, backup systems, and
    cloud storage environments.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Hybrid Crime-Hacktivist Model"
      value: >-
        Black Shadow operates a hybrid model combining financial extortion with ideological
        objectives aligned with Iranian geopolitical interests, blurring the line between
        cybercrime and state-sponsored hacktivism against Israeli targets.
    - key: "Data Weaponization"
      value: >-
        The group deliberately targets and leaks sensitive personal data including medical records
        and LGBTQ+ dating profiles, weaponizing data exposure for maximum psychological impact
        beyond traditional financial extortion.
