# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Red October (Operation Red October) was a sophisticated cyber-espionage campaign discovered by Kaspersky Lab in January 2013, assessed to have been active since at least 2007. The operation targeted diplomatic embassies, government agencies, scientific research institutions, military organizations, nuclear and energy infrastructure, and oil and gas companies across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and former Soviet republics. The campaign's origin remains debated, with indicators pointing to Russian-speaking operators using Chinese-origin exploit code."
  why: "Red October was significant as one of the most extensive and sophisticated cyber-espionage operations discovered at the time, demonstrating the ability to harvest intelligence from a wide range of device types including computers, smartphones, and network equipment. The campaign's multi-year duration and broad targeting of diplomatic and government entities across dozens of countries highlighted the scale of state-sponsored cyber-espionage threats."
  how: "Red October delivered weaponized Microsoft Office documents exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2010-3333, CVE-2012-0158) via spear-phishing. The modular malware framework supported over 30 plugin modules for data collection from various sources including local files, email databases, smartphones, USB drives, and network equipment. The infrastructure used over 60 domain names across multiple countries. Data was exfiltrated through a complex proxy chain to command-and-control servers."
