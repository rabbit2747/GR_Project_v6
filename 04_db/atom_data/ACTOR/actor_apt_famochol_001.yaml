# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Famous Chollima, most widely known as the Lazarus Group, is the umbrella designation for North Korean state-sponsored cyber operations attributed to the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). Active since at least 2009, the Lazarus Group encompasses multiple subgroups including BlueNoroff (financial theft), Andariel (defense/industrial espionage), Diamond Sleet (supply chain), and others. The group is responsible for some of the most impactful cyber operations in history, including the Sony Pictures attack (2014), WannaCry ransomware (2017), the Bangladesh Bank heist (2016), and over three billion dollars in cryptocurrency theft."
  why: "The Lazarus Group is arguably the most versatile and consequential state-sponsored threat actor, conducting operations spanning destructive attacks, financial theft, espionage, and ransomware. They serve as North Korea's primary tool for both revenue generation to fund weapons programs and strategic intelligence collection. The group's evolution from destructive attacks to sophisticated financial crime and supply chain compromise demonstrates exceptional adaptability and represents a sustained threat to global financial systems, technology companies, and government institutions."
  how: "Lazarus Group employs an extensive array of techniques including spearphishing, supply chain compromise, social engineering, watering hole attacks, and zero-day exploitation. Their malware arsenal includes hundreds of custom tools spanning Windows, macOS, and Linux. Key toolkits include FALLCHILL, HOPLIGHT, BLINDINGCAN, and numerous cryptocurrency-specific stealers. Financial operations target SWIFT banking networks, cryptocurrency exchanges, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms. Destructive operations use custom wipers and ransomware. The group maintains global operational infrastructure and has demonstrated the ability to conduct large-scale, coordinated campaigns across multiple targets simultaneously."
