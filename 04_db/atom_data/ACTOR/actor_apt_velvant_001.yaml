# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Velvet Ant is a China-nexus advanced persistent threat group identified by Sygnia in 2024, notable for maintaining persistent access within a large organization's network for approximately three years. The group is distinguished by its exploitation of legacy F5 BIG-IP appliances as internal C2 nodes and its abuse of outdated network infrastructure to evade modern security controls. Velvet Ant demonstrated extreme patience and sophistication in maintaining long-term undetected access."
  why: "Velvet Ant highlights the critical security risk posed by legacy and end-of-life network appliances within enterprise environments. The group's ability to maintain persistent access for years by living within network infrastructure rather than endpoints demonstrates a significant blind spot in many organizations' security monitoring. The case underscores the danger of unmanaged or poorly monitored network devices as potential pivot points."
  how: "Velvet Ant exploited and maintained access to legacy F5 BIG-IP load balancer appliances that lacked endpoint detection capabilities, using them as internal C2 relay points. The group deployed the PlugX malware with a sophisticated multi-hop proxy chain through internal network devices, making C2 traffic appear as legitimate internal communications. They leveraged outdated Windows Server systems for lateral movement and deployed custom tools for credential harvesting. The group maintained multiple redundant persistence mechanisms to survive partial remediation attempts."
  core_concepts:
