# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Operation Poisoned Handover is a cyber espionage campaign attributed to APT12 (also known as IXESHE, DynCalc, and Numbered Panda), a Chinese state-sponsored threat group. The operation targeted media organizations, particularly those covering topics sensitive to China, using watering hole attacks on legitimate news websites and spear-phishing campaigns. The campaign was documented by FireEye in 2014 and demonstrated strategic interest in controlling narratives and monitoring journalists."
  why: "The campaign aimed to compromise journalists, media organizations, and individuals consuming news about China-sensitive topics including Uyghur issues, Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Intelligence collection from media targets supports Chinese government efforts to monitor reporting on sensitive domestic issues, track journalist sources, and understand foreign media coverage strategies."
  how: "The operation used a combination of strategic web compromises (watering holes) on legitimate news websites popular among the target audience and spear-phishing emails with current-events themed lures. Compromised websites served exploits targeting Internet Explorer vulnerabilities to deliver custom backdoors. The campaign also used poisoned document files exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities. Malware deployed included RIPTIDE, HIGHTIDE, and WATERSPOUT backdoors, with C2 infrastructure that dynamically changed to evade detection."
