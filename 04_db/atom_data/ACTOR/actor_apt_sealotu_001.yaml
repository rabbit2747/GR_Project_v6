# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Sea Lotus, most commonly tracked as OceanLotus or APT32, is a Vietnam-nexus advanced persistent threat group active since at least 2012. The group conducts cyber-espionage operations targeting foreign governments, journalists, dissidents, and private sector organizations in Southeast Asia, with particular focus on entities relevant to Vietnamese political and economic interests. Sea Lotus is also known for targeting multinational corporations with business interests in Vietnam."
  why: "Sea Lotus is one of the most technically sophisticated APT groups in Southeast Asia, demonstrating advanced capabilities including supply chain compromises, macOS malware development, and innovative social engineering techniques. The group's targeting of foreign corporations operating in Vietnam, combined with espionage against government and dissident targets, indicates a dual mission supporting both national security and economic intelligence objectives."
  how: "Sea Lotus employs highly targeted spear-phishing campaigns with meticulously crafted social engineering, watering hole attacks on Vietnamese-language websites, and strategic web compromises. The group deploys custom malware including METALJACK, Kerrdown, Denis, and macOS-specific backdoors. It uses Cobalt Strike extensively, implements sophisticated multi-stage infection chains with obfuscated loaders, and leverages steganography to hide payloads. C2 infrastructure frequently uses DNS tunneling and dead-drop resolvers."
