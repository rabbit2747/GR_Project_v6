# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "FortiGuard Labs is Fortinet's global threat intelligence and research organization, providing the security intelligence backbone for all Fortinet products. FortiGuard delivers real-time security updates including intrusion prevention signatures, antivirus/anti-malware engines, web filtering, application control, anti-spam, and botnet C2 detection across the Fortinet Security Fabric. The organization employs hundreds of security researchers and analysts who track global threats, discover zero-day vulnerabilities, and publish threat research."
  why: "FortiGuard Labs is a cornerstone of global network security because Fortinet is one of the most deployed network security platforms worldwide, with FortiGate firewalls protecting organizations across every industry sector. The quality and timeliness of FortiGuard's threat intelligence directly impacts the security of millions of networks. FortiGuard researchers regularly discover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in third-party software, contributing significantly to the broader vulnerability disclosure ecosystem."
  how: "FortiGuard Labs aggregates telemetry from millions of Fortinet sensors deployed worldwide, combined with honeypots, dark web monitoring, and partner intelligence sharing. Machine learning and AI-driven analysis processes billions of events daily to generate signatures, classifications, and threat intelligence. Updates are distributed to Fortinet products through the FortiGuard Distribution Network (FDN). The labs publish outbreak alerts, weekly threat intelligence reports, and detailed analysis through the FortiGuard website and Threat Intelligence Portal."
