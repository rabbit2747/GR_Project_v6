# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "DigiTrust was an industry initiative originally developed as a standardized identity framework for the digital advertising ecosystem, later absorbed by the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) Tech Lab. DigiTrust provided a shared, anonymized user token system designed to reduce the proliferation of third-party tracking cookies across the web. In the cybersecurity context, DigiTrust is relevant as an example of identity management and privacy-preserving technology in the advertising technology space."
  why: "DigiTrust is relevant to cybersecurity because digital advertising identity systems intersect with user privacy, tracking, and data protection concerns. The proliferation of third-party cookies and tracking technologies creates security and privacy risks, and industry efforts like DigiTrust attempted to standardize and reduce the tracking surface. Understanding advertising identity frameworks is important for assessing privacy risks and data protection compliance in web environments."
  how: "DigiTrust operated by providing a shared, anonymized user identifier token that participating advertising technology companies could use instead of deploying their own individual tracking cookies. This reduced the number of third-party cookies per user, consolidating identity signals while attempting to preserve some degree of user privacy. The system relied on JavaScript libraries embedded in publisher websites to generate and manage the shared identity token."
