# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    RansomHouse is a data extortion group that emerged in late 2021 and publicly distinguishes
    itself from traditional ransomware operations by claiming not to develop or deploy file
    encryption malware. Instead, RansomHouse positions itself as a "mediators" group that acquires
    stolen data, either through its own network intrusions or by purchasing data from other threat
    actors, and then extorts victim organizations by threatening to publish the stolen data. The
    group operates a Tor-based leak site where they list victims and progressively release data.
    RansomHouse has targeted organizations across healthcare, government, manufacturing, and
    technology sectors, with notable attacks including the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona in Spain
    (March 2023) and Semiconductor manufacturer AMD. The group maintains a public-facing persona
    that frames their activities as exposing poor security practices.
  why: >-
    RansomHouse represents the evolution of the extortion threat model beyond traditional ransomware,
    demonstrating that threat actors can successfully monetize data theft without developing or
    deploying encryption malware. This lower-complexity operational model reduces the technical
    barrier to entry for extortion operations while still generating significant revenue. The
    group's public narrative of "helping" organizations by exposing security failures is a social
    engineering technique designed to shift blame to victims and normalize their criminal activity.
    RansomHouse's targeting of healthcare organizations, exemplified by the Barcelona hospital
    attack, demonstrates the real-world consequences of data extortion on critical services. The
    group also acts as a data marketplace, purchasing and reselling stolen data from other
    criminals, further blurring the lines between data brokers and extortionists.
  how: >-
    RansomHouse gains access to victim data through multiple methods. Direct network intrusions
    exploit known vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems, VPN appliances, and web applications.
    The group also acquires stolen data by purchasing breached databases and credentials from
    initial access brokers and other cybercriminal groups on dark web forums. In some cases,
    RansomHouse has been observed deploying legitimate penetration testing tools for network
    reconnaissance and data collection. Data exfiltration targets sensitive business information,
    intellectual property, personal data, and financial records. The extortion process begins with
    private communication to victims through Telegram or email, demanding payment to prevent
    publication. If negotiations fail, data is progressively published on the RansomHouse Tor
    leak site. Despite claims of not using encryption, some RansomHouse-affiliated attacks have
    involved ransomware variants including MarioLocker, suggesting the group may use encryption
    when operationally advantageous.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Encryption-Free Extortion"
      value: >-
        RansomHouse publicly distances itself from ransomware encryption, focusing on data theft
        and extortion as a standalone business model, though some affiliated operations have
        deployed encryption tools when opportunistic.
    - key: "Data Broker-Extortionist Hybrid"
      value: >-
        The group operates as both a direct threat actor conducting network intrusions and as a
        data marketplace, purchasing stolen data from other criminals and monetizing it through
        extortion, creating a hybrid criminal model.
