  what: >-
    Luna Road is a cybercriminal group specializing in cryptocurrency theft, social engineering,
    and financial fraud operations targeting individuals and organizations in the cryptocurrency
    and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The group conducts elaborate social engineering
    campaigns, phishing attacks, and credential harvesting operations designed to compromise
    cryptocurrency wallets, exchange accounts, and DeFi protocol access keys. Luna Road operations
    include SIM swapping attacks to bypass multi-factor authentication, impersonation of
    cryptocurrency project founders and venture capitalists, and deployment of malicious browser
    extensions and wallet drainers. The group operates across multiple dark web forums and
    encrypted messaging platforms, coordinating with other cybercriminal actors in the cryptocurrency
    fraud ecosystem.
  why: >-
    Luna Road represents the growing threat to the cryptocurrency ecosystem from organized
    cybercriminal groups that specialize in blockchain-related financial crime. The explosion of
    DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and cryptocurrency exchanges has created a large and
    lucrative attack surface that groups like Luna Road systematically exploit. Cryptocurrency
    theft is particularly damaging because blockchain transactions are typically irreversible,
    and the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency makes fund recovery extremely difficult.
    Social engineering attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders and project teams have resulted
    in individual losses ranging from thousands to millions of dollars. The group's operations
    demonstrate how traditional cybercriminal techniques like phishing and SIM swapping are
    being adapted specifically for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
  how: >-
    Luna Road employs multiple attack vectors targeting the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Social
    engineering campaigns impersonate venture capitalists, project founders, or exchange support
    staff to trick victims into revealing seed phrases, private keys, or approving malicious
    smart contract transactions. SIM swapping attacks target cryptocurrency holders by
    compromising mobile carrier accounts to intercept SMS-based two-factor authentication codes
    for exchange accounts. Phishing sites clone legitimate cryptocurrency exchange and DeFi
    protocol interfaces to harvest credentials and wallet connections. Malicious browser extensions
    masquerade as legitimate cryptocurrency wallet tools while intercepting and redirecting
    transactions. The group also deploys wallet drainer scripts on compromised websites and social
    media platforms, using approval phishing to trick victims into signing malicious transactions
    that drain their cryptocurrency holdings. Stolen funds are laundered through mixing services,
    cross-chain bridges, and decentralized exchanges.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Cryptocurrency-Focused Social Engineering"
      value: >-
        Luna Road specializes in social engineering techniques adapted for the cryptocurrency
        ecosystem, including impersonation of VCs and project founders, fake airdrop campaigns,
        and approval phishing designed to compromise wallet permissions.
    - key: "SIM Swap and Authentication Bypass"
      value: >-
        The group uses SIM swapping attacks to compromise mobile phone accounts and bypass
        SMS-based multi-factor authentication protecting cryptocurrency exchange accounts,
        enabling unauthorized access and fund theft.
