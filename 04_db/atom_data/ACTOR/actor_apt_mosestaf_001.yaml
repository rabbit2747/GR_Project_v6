# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Moses Staff is an Iranian-linked hacktivist and APT group that emerged in September 2021, conducting destructive attacks primarily against Israeli organizations. The group operates with political motivations aligned with Iranian interests, publicly leaking stolen data and deploying encryption tools without providing decryption keys, effectively functioning as a destructive actor disguised as ransomware. The group has connections to the persona Abraham's Ax."
  why: "Moses Staff operates as part of Iran's broader information warfare and destructive cyber campaign against Israel. The group aims to cause operational disruption, embarrassment, and psychological impact against Israeli organizations while publicly framing attacks as resistance operations. Their activities serve Iranian strategic objectives of pressuring Israel and demonstrating offensive cyber capabilities."
  how: "Moses Staff exploits known vulnerabilities in public-facing infrastructure, particularly Microsoft Exchange servers (ProxyShell) and other web applications, for initial access. The group deploys custom tools including PyDCrypt and DCSrv for disk encryption that intentionally provides no decryption mechanism, making attacks destructive rather than financially motivated. They use web shells for persistence, deploy custom backdoors, conduct lateral movement through Windows domains, and exfiltrate data before encryption for public leaking on their Telegram channel and dedicated leak site."
