# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Microsoft is the world's largest technology company and a dominant cybersecurity vendor through its Microsoft Security division. Security products include Microsoft Defender (endpoint, identity, cloud, Office 365), Microsoft Sentinel (cloud SIEM/SOAR), Entra ID (identity and access management), Intune (device management), and Azure security services. Microsoft is both the largest attack surface vendor (Windows, Office, Azure, Active Directory) and one of the largest security solution providers, processing over 65 trillion security signals daily."
  why: "Microsoft is uniquely important in cybersecurity as both the primary target of cyber attacks due to Windows, Active Directory, and Office ubiquity, and simultaneously a major security solution provider. Most enterprise environments depend on Microsoft infrastructure, making their security posture critical. Microsoft's vulnerability disclosures through Patch Tuesday directly drive patch management priorities globally, and their threat intelligence informs industry-wide defense strategies."
  how: "Microsoft provides security through integrated platform capabilities: Defender XDR for extended detection and response across endpoints, identity, email, and cloud workloads; Sentinel for cloud-native SIEM with AI-driven analytics; Entra ID for identity governance and conditional access; and Azure security services for cloud workload protection. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) tracks nation-state actors, publishes threat research, and coordinates vulnerability disclosure through MSRC."
