# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Spacehuhn Tech is a security research and tool development organization known for creating open-source WiFi security testing tools, particularly the ESP8266 Deauther project. The project provides affordable hardware-based WiFi deauthentication testing capabilities using low-cost ESP8266 microcontrollers, enabling security researchers and network administrators to test the resilience of wireless networks against deauthentication attacks."
  why: "Spacehuhn Tech is significant in cybersecurity because it democratized WiFi security testing by making affordable, accessible tools for wireless network assessment. The ESP8266 Deauther project highlighted the inherent vulnerability of the 802.11 deauthentication mechanism and raised awareness about the need for protected management frames (802.11w) in wireless network security."
  how: "Spacehuhn operates through open-source hardware and firmware projects that flash custom firmware onto ESP8266 microcontrollers, enabling them to perform WiFi deauthentication testing, beacon flooding, and probe request monitoring. The tools include a web-based interface for selecting targets and launching tests, making wireless security assessment accessible to researchers without expensive commercial equipment."
