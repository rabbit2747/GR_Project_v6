# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Tropic Trooper, also known as KeyBoy or Pirate Panda, is a China-nexus advanced persistent threat group active since at least 2011. The group conducts cyber-espionage operations targeting government agencies, military organizations, healthcare institutions, transportation entities, and high-technology companies in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Tropic Trooper has demonstrated persistence and adaptability across more than a decade of operations."
  why: "Tropic Trooper represents a persistent and evolving China-linked espionage threat to entities in the South China Sea region, particularly Taiwanese government and military organizations. The group's long operational history and continuous tooling evolution demonstrate sustained investment in intelligence collection from entities relevant to Chinese territorial claims and military interests in the Asia-Pacific."
  how: "Tropic Trooper employs spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader. The group deploys custom backdoors including Yahoyah, TClient, and USBferry (for targeting air-gapped networks via USB drives). It has expanded to Linux environments and compromised web servers for C2 and staging. Recent operations have targeted transportation and healthcare verticals, demonstrating expanded intelligence collection interests. The group uses multi-stage infection chains with encrypted payloads and shellcode loaders."
