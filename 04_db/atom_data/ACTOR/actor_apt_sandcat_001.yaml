# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "SandCat is a threat actor attributed to the Uzbekistan State Security Service (SSS), identified by Kaspersky Lab researchers in 2019. The group was discovered operating cyber-espionage campaigns targeting journalists, dissidents, human rights activists, and foreign diplomats, primarily in Central Asia and the Middle East. SandCat is notable for having purchased commercial spyware and exploit capabilities, including tools from NSO Group and the FinFisher suite, while also attempting to develop indigenous cyber capabilities."
  why: "SandCat is significant as an example of a smaller nation-state acquiring commercial surveillance and exploit capabilities to conduct targeted espionage. The group's operations highlight the proliferation of commercial spyware to governments with human rights concerns and the challenge of regulating the commercial surveillance industry."
  how: "SandCat acquired and deployed commercial exploitation tools including NSO Group's Pegasus mobile spyware and FinFisher surveillance suite for targeting mobile devices and desktop systems. The group also attempted to develop custom exploits, though poor operational security led to the discovery of their test infrastructure by security researchers. Attacks involved zero-day exploits targeting browsers and messaging applications, as well as spear-phishing campaigns with malicious attachments."
