# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Red Hotel, also tracked as TAG-22 and Earth Lusca, is a China-nexus advanced persistent threat group that conducts both cyber-espionage and financially motivated intrusions. The group targets government organizations, academic institutions, telecommunications providers, technology companies, and gambling operations across Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and other regions. Red Hotel has been active since at least 2019 and demonstrates sophisticated capabilities spanning both Windows and Linux environments."
  why: "Red Hotel poses a dual threat through its combination of state-sponsored espionage and financially motivated criminal activity. The group's targeting of government, telecom, and technology sectors provides strategic intelligence value, while its parallel financially motivated operations against gambling and cryptocurrency entities indicate a broader mandate or independent revenue generation for the group."
  how: "Red Hotel exploits public-facing web applications and servers using known vulnerabilities including Log4Shell, ProxyShell, and other n-day exploits. The group deploys a diverse malware arsenal including Cobalt Strike, ShadowPad, Winnti, FunnySwitch, and SprySOCKS (a Linux backdoor). They leverage virtual private servers for C2 operations and employ credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration techniques. The group also conducts watering hole attacks and spear-phishing campaigns."
