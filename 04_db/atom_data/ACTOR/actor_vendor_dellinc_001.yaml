# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Dell Technologies is a multinational technology corporation providing enterprise hardware, software, and security solutions. In the cybersecurity context, Dell is relevant as a major server and endpoint hardware manufacturer whose supply chain, firmware, and driver software are targets for threat actors. Dell also provides data protection solutions (Dell EMC), and previously owned SecureWorks, a major managed security services provider. Dell's hardware, BIOS, and driver updates are critical components of enterprise security infrastructure."
  why: "Dell is significant in cybersecurity because its enterprise hardware constitutes a major portion of the world's server and endpoint infrastructure. Vulnerabilities in Dell BIOS/UEFI firmware, drivers, and management tools (such as iDRAC) can provide attackers with persistent, pre-OS access to systems. Dell's supply chain integrity is critical, and compromises of Dell hardware or software distribution have serious downstream security implications."
  how: "Dell provides enterprise security through hardware security features including Secure Boot, TPM integration, firmware attestation, and iDRAC management controllers. Dell EMC provides data protection and backup solutions. Dell publishes security advisories for firmware and driver vulnerabilities, provides BIOS/firmware updates, and operates Dell's Product Security Incident Response Team for vulnerability coordination."
