# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Op Jerusalem (Operation Parliament) is a targeted cyber espionage campaign attributed to the Gaza Cybergang, active since at least 2018, targeting high-profile political entities including parliaments, senates, government offices, and political figures primarily in the Middle East and North Africa region. The operation was documented by Kaspersky and focuses on politically sensitive targets with connections to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
  why: "The operation aims to collect political intelligence on governmental decision-making processes, parliamentary deliberations, and diplomatic positions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and broader Middle Eastern geopolitics. Targets are selected based on their political significance and potential intelligence value regarding regional power dynamics and peace process developments."
  how: "The campaign employs spear-phishing emails with politically themed lures relevant to current events in the Middle East, delivering weaponized documents that exploit Microsoft Office vulnerabilities. Malware deployed includes custom backdoors with keylogging, screenshot capture, and document theft capabilities. The attackers use multi-stage infection chains with initial downloaders leading to more capable implants, and establish C2 through HTTP-based protocols with basic encryption. The operation demonstrates moderate sophistication with focus on intelligence value over technical complexity."
