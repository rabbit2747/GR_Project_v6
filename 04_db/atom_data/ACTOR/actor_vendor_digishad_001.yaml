# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Digital Shadows (now part of ReliaQuest) is a digital risk protection company that monitors the open, deep, and dark web for threats to organizations. The company's SearchLight platform provides external threat intelligence, data leak detection, brand protection, attack surface monitoring, and dark web surveillance. Digital Shadows specializes in identifying exposed credentials, sensitive document leaks, phishing infrastructure, and threat actor activity targeting specific organizations."
  why: "Digital Shadows is significant in cybersecurity because external digital risk represents a growing attack surface that traditional perimeter-focused security tools do not address. By monitoring criminal forums, paste sites, dark web marketplaces, and code repositories, Digital Shadows provides early warning of data breaches, credential theft, planned attacks, and brand impersonation, enabling proactive rather than reactive security postures."
  how: "Digital Shadows operates the SearchLight platform that continuously monitors thousands of sources across the open, deep, and dark web using automated collection systems and analyst curation. The platform identifies exposed data, credentials, infrastructure, and threat actor discussions relevant to customers. Alerts are enriched with context and delivered through an API and portal, integrating with SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence platforms for automated response workflows."
