definition:
  what: >-
    CAN CAN Community is a hacktivist collective that conducts ideologically motivated cyber
    operations including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, website defacements, data
    breaches, and information operations against government entities and organizations perceived
    as adversaries to their political causes. The group operates through decentralized coordination
    on encrypted messaging platforms and social media, recruiting participants for campaigns that
    align with their ideological objectives. CAN CAN Community engages in coordinated cyber campaigns
    targeting government websites, critical infrastructure portals, and corporate entities,
    typically timed to coincide with geopolitical events, political decisions, or social
    controversies. The group shares DDoS tools, target lists, and attack methodologies with
    participants through Telegram channels and dark web forums.
  why: >-
    CAN CAN Community represents the hacktivist threat model where ideologically motivated groups
    use cyber operations to advance political agendas, disrupt government services, and attract
    public attention to their causes. While hacktivist groups are generally less technically
    sophisticated than nation-state actors or professional cybercriminal organizations, their
    willingness to target government infrastructure and their ability to mobilize distributed
    participants make them a persistent operational concern. DDoS attacks and website defacements
    from hacktivist groups can disrupt government services, damage public confidence, and create
    distractions that may be exploited by more sophisticated threat actors. The decentralized
    nature of hacktivist collectives makes them difficult to predict, attribute, and disrupt
    through traditional law enforcement methods.
  how: >-
    CAN CAN Community conducts operations primarily through coordinated DDoS campaigns using
    publicly available DDoS tools (LOIC, HOIC, custom scripts) and commercial DDoS-for-hire
    (booter/stresser) services to overwhelm target web infrastructure. Website defacement
    operations exploit vulnerabilities in content management systems, web applications, and
    hosting platforms to replace legitimate content with hacktivist messaging. Data breach
    operations target poorly secured databases, exposed APIs, and misconfigured cloud storage
    to exfiltrate and leak sensitive information for public exposure. The group coordinates
    campaigns through Telegram channels, sharing target lists, attack timing, and tool
    configurations. Recruitment and mobilization occur through social media campaigns that
    frame participation as activism. Some operations involve the creation of fake social media
    accounts and disinformation campaigns to amplify the impact of their cyber operations.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Decentralized Hacktivist Coordination"
      value: >-
        CAN CAN Community operates as a decentralized collective coordinating through encrypted
        messaging platforms, enabling rapid mobilization of participants for campaigns while
        making the group difficult to attribute and disrupt through traditional methods.
    - key: "Ideologically Motivated Cyber Operations"
      value: >-
        The group's operations are driven by political and ideological objectives rather than
        financial gain, targeting government entities and organizations perceived as adversaries
        to advance specific political causes and attract public attention.

    CAN CAN Community is a hacktivist collective conducting ideologically motivated cyber operations
    including DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, and information operations against
    government entities and organizations. The group coordinates through decentralized encrypted
    messaging platforms and Telegram channels, recruiting participants and sharing DDoS tools,
    target lists, and attack methodologies. Operations are typically timed to coincide with
    geopolitical events and political controversies. CAN CAN Community uses publicly available DDoS
    tools, booter/stresser services, and CMS vulnerability exploitation for defacement campaigns.
    Data breach operations target exposed databases and misconfigured cloud storage. The group
    represents the hacktivist threat model where ideologically motivated actors use cyber operations
    to disrupt government services and advance political agendas. Their decentralized nature makes
    attribution and disruption challenging. While generally less sophisticated than nation-state
    actors, their persistent targeting of government infrastructure poses ongoing operational
    concerns for defenders.
