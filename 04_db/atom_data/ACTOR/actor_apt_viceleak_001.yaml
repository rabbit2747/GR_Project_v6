# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Vice Leaker is a threat actor group identified by Kaspersky Lab in 2018, conducting targeted mobile surveillance campaigns against individuals in the Middle East, particularly in Israel and Palestine. The group develops and deploys trojanized Android applications designed to conduct comprehensive surveillance of targeted individuals' mobile devices. Vice Leaker has been linked to broader Middle Eastern cyber-espionage operations with possible Iranian connections."
  why: "Vice Leaker demonstrates the growing threat of mobile-focused espionage operations in the Middle East, where mobile devices are primary communication tools. The group's ability to create convincing trojanized versions of legitimate messaging applications highlights the risk of mobile supply chain attacks and the challenge of defending mobile devices against sophisticated surveillance operations."
  how: "Vice Leaker creates trojanized versions of popular messaging applications such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and other legitimate apps, injecting surveillance capabilities into functional application code using Baksmali/Smali injection techniques. These modified applications retain full legitimate functionality while secretly recording calls, capturing SMS messages, harvesting contacts, tracking location, and exfiltrating files. Distribution occurs through targeted spear-phishing messages and potentially through third-party app stores. The group has also used custom Android backdoors with comprehensive surveillance capabilities."
