# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "ZecOps is a cybersecurity vendor specializing in mobile device forensics, automated crash log analysis, and mobile threat detection. The company developed technology to detect zero-click exploits and advanced mobile attacks by analyzing device crash logs and system artifacts, focusing on identifying evidence of iOS and Android exploitation without requiring jailbreaking or rooting the target device."
  why: "ZecOps is significant in cybersecurity because mobile device exploitation by nation-state actors represents one of the most concerning threat vectors, yet traditional forensics tools require device modification. ZecOps pioneered non-invasive mobile forensics through crash log analysis, and the company's research disclosed notable iOS vulnerabilities and identified evidence of in-the-wild mobile exploitation campaigns."
  how: "ZecOps operates through automated analysis of mobile device crash logs, system diagnostics, and OS artifacts to detect indicators of exploitation. The technology identifies crash patterns consistent with known and unknown exploits, buffer overflows, and use-after-free vulnerabilities without requiring device jailbreaking. The company also conducts mobile vulnerability research, discovering and responsibly disclosing iOS and Android security flaws."
