# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Bugcrowd is a crowdsourced cybersecurity platform founded in 2012, connecting organizations with a global community of security researchers through bug bounty programs, vulnerability disclosure programs, and penetration testing as a service. The platform enables organizations to leverage a crowd of ethical hackers to discover vulnerabilities in their applications, APIs, networks, and infrastructure before malicious actors can exploit them."
  why: "Bugcrowd is significant because it pioneered the crowdsourced security testing model, which provides organizations with access to a diverse pool of security researchers with varied skills and perspectives that no single internal team can replicate. Bug bounty programs have become an industry standard for vulnerability discovery, and Bugcrowd's platform helps manage the entire lifecycle of vulnerability disclosure and remediation."
  how: "Bugcrowd operates a platform that manages bug bounty programs, vulnerability disclosure programs, and pentest-as-a-service engagements. Organizations define scope and reward structures, and vetted security researchers submit vulnerability reports through the platform. Bugcrowd's triage team validates submissions, manages researcher communications, and provides analytics on vulnerability trends. The platform integrates with development workflows for remediation tracking."
