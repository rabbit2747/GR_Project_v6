# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Pitty Tiger is a suspected Chinese APT group that has been active since at least 2011, targeting defense, telecommunications, and government organizations primarily in Western Europe and the United States. The group was documented by Airbus Defence and Space (formerly Cassidian CyberSecurity) in 2014 and is characterized by its use of a mix of custom and publicly available tools for espionage operations."
  why: "Pitty Tiger conducts cyber espionage operations likely aligned with Chinese intelligence collection priorities, targeting defense industry trade secrets, military technology, telecommunications infrastructure information, and government policy intelligence from Western nations. The targeting pattern suggests interest in defense technology acquisition and strategic political intelligence."
  how: "The group uses spear-phishing emails with weaponized documents exploiting common Office vulnerabilities and targeted social engineering. Pitty Tiger deploys a combination of custom backdoors (CT RAT, PittyTiger RAT) alongside widely available tools like Gh0st RAT and PCShare. The group employs DLL side-loading for persistence, uses HTTP-based C2 with basic obfuscation, and conducts systematic file collection and exfiltration. Their operations demonstrate moderate technical sophistication with heavy reliance on known effective techniques."
