# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Drifting Cloud is a Chinese APT activity cluster identified by Volexity, known for exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in internet-facing network appliances, particularly Sophos firewalls and other perimeter devices. The group targets government, telecommunications, and technology organizations. In 2022, Volexity attributed the exploitation of a Sophos Firewall zero-day (CVE-2022-1040) to this group, demonstrating their capability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in network security appliances before patches are available."
  why: "Drifting Cloud is significant because they specialize in exploiting the very security devices organizations rely on for perimeter protection. By compromising firewalls and other network appliances, the group gains a privileged position within the network, enabling traffic interception, credential harvesting, and persistent access that is extremely difficult to detect through standard endpoint monitoring. Their focus on edge device zero-days represents a growing trend among Chinese APT groups."
  how: "The group discovers and exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in internet-facing appliances such as Sophos firewalls. After exploiting CVE-2022-1040 (authentication bypass in Sophos Firewall User Portal and Webadmin), they installed web shells and backdoors on the compromised appliance. From this position, they harvested credentials, performed man-in-the-middle attacks on traffic passing through the firewall, and used the compromised device as a pivot point for lateral movement into internal networks. The group deploys custom web shells and lightweight backdoors designed for embedded Linux systems."
