# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "IronNet Cybersecurity was a network detection and response (NDR) company founded by former NSA director General Keith Alexander. The company developed IronDefense, an AI-driven network traffic analysis platform, and IronDome, a collective defense sharing system that enabled anonymous threat intelligence sharing across organizations. IronNet filed for bankruptcy in 2023 but its technology and approach to collective defense influenced the broader NDR market."
  why: "IronNet was notable in cybersecurity for pioneering the concept of collective defense through real-time anonymous threat sharing between organizations. Their AI-driven behavioral analytics approach to network detection represented an evolution beyond signature-based intrusion detection. Understanding IronNet's contributions helps contextualize the development of network detection and response technology and collective defense strategies."
  how: "IronNet's IronDefense platform used behavioral analytics and machine learning to detect anomalous network traffic patterns indicating cyber threats. IronDome aggregated anonymized threat data across participating organizations to identify coordinated attacks and enable collective response. The platform integrated with existing security infrastructure through APIs and provided network visibility through packet capture and flow analysis at enterprise scale."

  embedding_text: "IronNet Cybersecurity was a network detection and response company founded by former NSA director General Keith Alexander, focused on AI-driven network traffic analysis and collective defense capabilities. The company developed IronDefense, a behavioral analytics platform using machine learning to detect anomalous network traffic patterns indicating cyber threats, and IronDome, a collective defense system enabling anonymous real-time threat intelligence sharing across participating organizations. IronDome represented an innovative approach to collaborative cybersecurity by aggregating anonymized threat data to identify coordinated attacks and enable collective response without exposing sensitive organizational information. Although IronNet filed for bankruptcy in 2023, its contributions to network detection and response technology and the concept of collective defense influenced how the cybersecurity industry approaches collaborative threat detection and cross-organizational information sharing for cyber defense."
