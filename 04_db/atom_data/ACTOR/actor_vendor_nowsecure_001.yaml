definition:
  what: "NowSecure (formerly viaForensics) is a mobile application security company that provides automated mobile app security testing, mobile penetration testing, and mobile threat defense solutions. The company's platform performs static and dynamic analysis of iOS and Android applications to identify vulnerabilities, insecure data storage, network communication weaknesses, and compliance gaps. NowSecure is recognized as a leader in mobile application security testing (MAST)."
  why: "NowSecure is significant in cybersecurity because mobile applications are increasingly targeted by attackers, and traditional security testing tools do not adequately address mobile-specific vulnerabilities. NowSecure's research has uncovered critical vulnerabilities in popular mobile applications and SDKs, contributing to improved mobile security practices. Their platform helps organizations ensure compliance with mobile security standards including OWASP Mobile Top 10 and various regulatory frameworks."
  how: "NowSecure's platform performs automated security testing of mobile applications through static analysis (SAST), dynamic analysis (DAST), and interactive application security testing (IAST) on real devices. The platform analyzes binary code, network communications, data storage practices, cryptographic implementations, and runtime behavior. Results include vulnerability reports with remediation guidance mapped to OWASP Mobile Top 10 and MASVS standards. The company also provides manual penetration testing services and mobile threat intelligence."
