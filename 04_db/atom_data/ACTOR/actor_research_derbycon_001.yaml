  what: "DerbyCon was an annual information security conference held in Louisville, Kentucky from 2011 to 2019, founded by Dave Kennedy and Martin Bos. The conference was known for its strong community focus, affordable pricing, and high-quality technical talks covering penetration testing, red teaming, social engineering, exploit development, and defensive security. DerbyCon was widely regarded as one of the most community-oriented hacker conferences, featuring a single-track format that promoted shared experiences and networking among attendees."

Many significant security tools, techniques, and research findings were first presented at DerbyCon. Although the conference ended in 2019, its recorded talks remain a valuable educational resource, and its community-first model influenced the design of subsequent security conferences."
