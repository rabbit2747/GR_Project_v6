# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "WinterVivern, also tracked as TA473 by Proofpoint and UAC-0114 by Ukraine CERT, is a threat actor group with suspected ties to Belarus and Russia, active since at least 2021. The group conducts cyber-espionage operations targeting European government entities, military organizations, and diplomatic missions, with particular focus on organizations involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. WinterVivern is known for exploiting vulnerabilities in webmail platforms, particularly Zimbra and Roundcube."
  why: "WinterVivern is significant for its targeted exploitation of government webmail infrastructure across Europe, particularly entities providing support to Ukraine. The group's rapid exploitation of webmail vulnerabilities, including zero-day exploits in Roundcube, demonstrates focused capability development aimed at collecting diplomatic and military intelligence related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and European defense cooperation."
  how: "WinterVivern exploits cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in webmail platforms including Zimbra Collaboration Suite and Roundcube Webmail to steal email credentials and access mailbox contents. The group sends specially crafted phishing emails containing malicious JavaScript payloads that execute within the webmail context when opened. Notable exploits include CVE-2023-5631 (Roundcube XSS zero-day) and CVE-2022-27926 (Zimbra XSS). The group also creates malicious websites impersonating legitimate government portals and uses custom PowerShell-based downloaders for additional malware delivery."
