definition:
  what: "HackerOne is a leading bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure platform that connects organizations with a global community of ethical hackers and security researchers. Founded in 2012, the platform facilitates coordinated vulnerability disclosure, manages bug bounty programs, and provides penetration testing as a service. HackerOne serves major enterprises, government agencies including the U.S. Department of Defense, and technology companies seeking to identify security vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them."
  why: "HackerOne is a critical entity in the cybersecurity ecosystem because it institutionalizes vulnerability discovery through crowdsourced security testing. The platform's disclosed vulnerabilities directly inform threat intelligence, patch management priorities, and defensive strategies. Understanding HackerOne's role helps security teams leverage external researcher communities and assess the vulnerability landscape across industries."
  how: "HackerOne operates a managed platform where organizations define scope, set bounty amounts, and receive vulnerability reports from registered security researchers. Reports go through triage and validation processes before being disclosed to the affected organization. The platform provides reputation scoring for researchers, handles payment disbursement, supports coordinated disclosure timelines, and offers compliance reporting. HackerOne also runs Hack the Pentagon and similar government programs."
