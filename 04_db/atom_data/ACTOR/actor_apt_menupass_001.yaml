# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "MenuPass (also known as APT10, Stone Panda, and Cicada) is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage group attributed to the Tianjin State Security Bureau of the Ministry of State Security (MSS). Active since at least 2006, the group is notorious for its Operation Cloud Hopper campaign that targeted managed IT service providers (MSPs) to gain access to their clients' networks at scale, affecting organizations across healthcare, defense, aerospace, government, and technology sectors globally."
  why: "MenuPass conducts espionage operations supporting Chinese economic and strategic intelligence priorities, including trade secrets theft, intellectual property acquisition, and political intelligence gathering. The group's innovative supply chain approach through MSP compromise allowed simultaneous access to multiple high-value targets across industries, serving China's industrial modernization and military advancement goals."
  how: "The group is best known for compromising managed service providers to pivot into client networks (Operation Cloud Hopper). Attack techniques include spear-phishing with weaponized documents, exploitation of public-facing applications, deployment of custom malware including PlugX, QuasarRAT, Poison Ivy, and the ANEL backdoor, use of DLL side-loading for persistence, and living-off-the-land techniques. They conduct systematic lateral movement through Active Directory environments and exfiltrate large volumes of data through encrypted channels."

Attack techniques include spear-phishing, exploitation of public-facing applications, deployment of custom malware such as PlugX, QuasarRAT, and ANEL backdoor, DLL side-loading, and systematic lateral movement through Active Directory. Two members were indicted by the US Department of Justice in 2018. MenuPass represents one of the most significant examples of supply chain compromise for cyber espionage, demonstrating how targeting service providers enables scaled access to multiple high-value organizations simultaneously."
