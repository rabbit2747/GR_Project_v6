# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "arXiv is an open-access preprint repository hosted by Cornell University, established in 1991, that publishes scholarly articles in computer science, mathematics, physics, and related fields. Within cybersecurity, arXiv serves as a primary venue for publishing cutting-edge research on cryptography, adversarial machine learning, network security, malware analysis, privacy-preserving computation, and AI security. Security researchers, academic institutions, and industry labs frequently publish vulnerability research, novel attack techniques, and defensive methodologies on the platform before formal peer review."
  why: "arXiv is critical to the cybersecurity research ecosystem because it enables rapid dissemination of security findings, novel attack and defense techniques, and foundational research in cryptography and AI security. Many significant security breakthroughs, including adversarial ML attacks, side-channel discoveries, and cryptographic advances, first appear as arXiv preprints before formal publication."
  how: "Researchers submit preprints to arXiv which are made publicly available after a basic moderation check. The platform enables open access to cutting-edge cybersecurity research, allowing practitioners to stay current with advances in threat modeling, vulnerability discovery, and defensive techniques. Papers are indexed and searchable, supporting systematic literature review and knowledge synthesis."
