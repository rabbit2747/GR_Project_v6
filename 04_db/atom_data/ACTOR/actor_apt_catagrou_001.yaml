# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Catalina Group is an Iranian APT cluster associated with the broader Charming Kitten (APT35/Phosphorus) operations. The group focuses on credential harvesting and social engineering campaigns targeting Iranian dissidents, academics, journalists, human rights activists, and Western policy researchers focused on Iran. The group is known for creating elaborate fake personas and phishing infrastructure to steal email credentials and monitor targets of interest to the Iranian government."
  why: "Catalina Group represents the Iranian government's domestic surveillance and foreign intelligence collection targeting individuals who influence policy discussions about Iran. Their operations against journalists, academics, and human rights activists demonstrate the use of cyber operations for political repression and monitoring of diaspora communities. Understanding their social engineering tradecraft is essential for protecting at-risk communities."
  how: "The group creates convincing fake social media profiles and impersonates journalists, conference organizers, or academics to build trust with targets over extended periods. They then direct targets to credential harvesting pages mimicking legitimate email providers including Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. The group has used SMS-based phishing, fake conference invitations, and compromised legitimate websites as watering holes. Some campaigns have delivered lightweight surveillance malware for ongoing monitoring of compromised accounts and devices."
