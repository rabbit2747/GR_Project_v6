# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "CactusPete, also known as Tonto Team, is a Chinese APT group active since at least 2012. The group targets military, diplomatic, and infrastructure organizations primarily in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States, with additional operations against Russia and Mongolia. CactusPete is believed to be affiliated with the Chinese People's Liberation Army and specializes in espionage operations targeting defense and government entities in the Asia-Pacific region."
  why: "CactusPete represents a persistent Chinese espionage threat focused on military and defense intelligence collection in the Asia-Pacific. The group's targeting of South Korean and Japanese military organizations, as well as Russian defense entities, provides strategic intelligence relevant to Chinese military planning and geopolitical maneuvering. Their long operational history demonstrates sustained state-directed collection requirements."
  how: "The group primarily uses spearphishing with weaponized Rich Text Format (RTF) documents exploiting known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-11882 (Equation Editor). They deploy the Bisonal backdoor family, a long-running custom RAT, along with newer tools such as the Tonto Loader and dddkong backdoor. Post-compromise activities include keylogging, screenshot capture, document theft, and lateral movement via stolen credentials. The group uses multiple layers of C2 infrastructure including compromised websites and custom domains."
