# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Earth Lusca is a Chinese APT group identified by Trend Micro, believed to be linked to the Winnti cluster. The group conducts both espionage and financially motivated operations, targeting government agencies, educational institutions, media organizations, religious groups, pro-democracy organizations, human rights groups, and cryptocurrency platforms. Earth Lusca has been active since at least 2019 and operates globally, with particular focus on Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and targets of Chinese political interest."
  why: "Earth Lusca is significant because it combines state-sponsored espionage objectives with financially motivated cybercrime, demonstrating the blurring line between APT and criminal operations in some Chinese threat groups. Their targeting of pro-democracy organizations, religious groups, and human rights entities alongside government targets highlights the use of cyber operations for political repression. The group's use of cloud infrastructure for C2 and data staging represents modern operational tradecraft."
  how: "The group uses spearphishing, watering hole attacks, and exploitation of internet-facing servers (ProxyShell, Log4Shell) for initial access. They deploy Cobalt Strike extensively alongside custom malware including SprySOCKS (a Linux backdoor) and ShadowPad. C2 infrastructure leverages cloud services and content delivery networks. The group also uses VPS-hosted infrastructure and DNS tunneling. Financially motivated operations involve cryptocurrency exchange targeting and theft. Post-exploitation uses a combination of open-source and custom tools for lateral movement and data exfiltration."
