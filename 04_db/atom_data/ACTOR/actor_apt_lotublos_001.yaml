# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Lotus Blossom (also known as Spring Dragon, Billbug, and Lotus Panda) is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2012, primarily targeting government and military organizations in Southeast Asia including Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The group is also known to target defense contractors, telecommunications, and satellite communications providers."
  why: "The group conducts espionage operations aligned with Chinese strategic interests in the South China Sea region and broader Southeast Asian geopolitics. Intelligence collection focuses on military capabilities, diplomatic communications, territorial disputes, and defense procurement of nations in China's sphere of influence. Operations against satellite and telecommunications providers support signals intelligence objectives."
  how: "Lotus Blossom relies heavily on spear-phishing emails with weaponized documents exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2012-0158. The group deploys custom backdoors including Elise (also known as BKDR_ESILE), Evora, and Hanover. They use DLL side-loading techniques for persistence, establish C2 through HTTP-based protocols with custom encoding, and conduct systematic document exfiltration from compromised networks. The group has also been observed using legitimate tools for lateral movement within target environments."
