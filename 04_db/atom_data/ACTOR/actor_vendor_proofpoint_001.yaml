  what: "Proofpoint is a leading cybersecurity company specializing in email security, data loss prevention, security awareness training, and threat intelligence. The company's platform protects against phishing, business email compromise (BEC), malware delivery, and social engineering attacks targeting email as the primary attack vector.
