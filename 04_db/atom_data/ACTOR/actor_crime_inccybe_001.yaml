# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    INC Ransom (INC Cyber) is a ransomware operation that emerged in August 2023, operating a
    double-extortion model where victims' data is both encrypted and exfiltrated, with stolen data
    published on a Tor-based leak site if ransom demands are not met. The group has targeted a wide
    range of organizations across healthcare, education, government, and technology sectors,
    primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe. INC Ransom is notable for its
    methodical approach to network compromise, spending significant time on reconnaissance and
    lateral movement before deploying ransomware. The group has been linked to attacks on major
    healthcare systems, including the NHS Scotland (Dumfries and Galloway Health Board) breach in
    2024, and has displayed technical sophistication in targeting both Windows and VMware ESXi
    environments.
  why: >-
    INC Ransom represents a significant and growing threat particularly to the healthcare sector,
    where ransomware attacks directly endanger patient safety and disrupt critical medical services.
    The group's methodical approach to network penetration, often spending days to weeks inside
    victim networks before encryption, makes detection challenging and maximizes the scope of data
    exfiltration. Their targeting of NHS Scotland in 2024 highlighted the vulnerability of national
    healthcare systems to ransomware attacks. INC Ransom has also been observed selling or sharing
    their ransomware source code on underground forums, potentially spawning derivative operations
    and expanding the threat beyond the original group. Microsoft tracks affiliates using INC
    ransomware as Vanilla Tempest.
  how: >-
    INC Ransom gains initial access through exploitation of internet-facing vulnerabilities,
    particularly Citrix NetScaler (CVE-2023-3519) and vulnerable VPN appliances, as well as
    phishing campaigns delivering malware loaders. Post-compromise, the group conducts extensive
    reconnaissance using tools including Advanced IP Scanner, AdFind for Active Directory
    enumeration, and various credential harvesting tools including Mimikatz and LSASS dumping.
    Lateral movement is achieved through RDP, PsExec, and SMB. Data exfiltration uses MegaSync
    and Rclone to cloud storage before ransomware deployment. The ransomware encrypts files using
    AES and RSA encryption algorithms and targets both Windows endpoints and VMware ESXi
    hypervisors. The group operates a Tor-based leak site called "INC BLOG" where stolen data
    is progressively published to pressure victims into paying.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Methodical Network Penetration"
      value: >-
        INC Ransom is characterized by extended dwell times within victim networks, conducting
        thorough reconnaissance and lateral movement over days to weeks before deploying
        ransomware, maximizing the scope of compromise and data exfiltration.
    - key: "Healthcare Sector Targeting"
      value: >-
        The group has demonstrated a pattern of targeting healthcare organizations, including
        national health services, where ransomware attacks pose direct threats to patient safety
        and medical service continuity.
