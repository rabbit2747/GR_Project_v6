# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Exploit Broker refers to cybercriminal actors and organizations that specialize in the discovery,
    acquisition, development, and sale of software exploits, including zero-day vulnerabilities, on
    underground forums, dark web marketplaces, and through private channels. These brokers operate
    within the cybercriminal ecosystem as specialized suppliers, providing weaponized exploit code to
    ransomware operators, advanced persistent threat groups, and other threat actors who lack the
    technical capability to develop exploits independently. The exploit broker market spans from
    low-cost known-vulnerability exploits ($100-$1,000) to high-value zero-day exploits for major
    platforms ($100,000-$2,500,000+). Notable commercial exploit brokers include Zerodium, which
    publicly advertises acquisition prices for zero-days, while underground brokers operate on forums
    like Exploit.in and XSS.is.
  why: >-
    Exploit brokers are a critical enabler in the cybercriminal supply chain, directly responsible
    for providing the initial access capabilities that make sophisticated attacks possible. The
    commercialization of exploit development has created a market where even low-sophistication
    threat actors can purchase weaponized access to target systems. Zero-day exploits sold through
    broker networks have been used in high-profile attacks including nation-state espionage campaigns
    and destructive ransomware operations. The exploit brokerage market also intersects with the
    legitimate vulnerability research industry, with some brokers operating in legal gray areas by
    selling to government agencies and law enforcement. Understanding exploit broker operations is
    essential for predicting emerging attack vectors and assessing the threat landscape.
  how: >-
    Exploit brokers operate through multiple channels. Underground market brokers maintain presences
    on Russian-language cybercriminal forums (Exploit.in, XSS.is, RAMP) and dark web marketplaces,
    advertising exploit capabilities and accepting commissions for targeted exploit development.
    Private broker networks operate through encrypted communication channels (Telegram, Jabber/XMPP,
    Signal) connecting exploit developers with buyers. Commercial brokers like Zerodium publish
    acquisition price lists and operate structured programs for purchasing vulnerabilities. The
    brokerage process typically involves: proof-of-concept demonstration, independent verification,
    escrow-based payment, and delivery of weaponized exploit code with documentation. Pricing is
    determined by target platform popularity, exploit reliability, and whether the vulnerability
    is zero-day versus N-day. Some brokers offer exploit-as-a-service models with ongoing
    maintenance as patches are released.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Exploit Supply Chain"
      value: >-
        Exploit brokers form a critical link in the cybercriminal supply chain, connecting
        vulnerability researchers and exploit developers with operational threat actors who deploy
        the exploits in attacks, creating a specialized marketplace for offensive capabilities.
    - key: "Zero-Day Market Economics"
      value: >-
        The zero-day market operates with pricing determined by platform prevalence, exploit
        reliability, and exclusivity, ranging from tens of thousands for mobile exploits to
        millions for full remote chains targeting iOS and major operating systems.

    forums and dark web marketplaces. These brokers operate as specialized suppliers in the
    cybercriminal supply chain, providing weaponized exploit code to ransomware operators, APT

    to high-value zero-days worth millions of dollars. Brokers operate on forums like Exploit.in
    and XSS.is, through private encrypted channels, and via commercial programs like Zerodium.
    The brokerage process involves proof-of-concept demonstration, verification, escrow payment,
    and delivery of weaponized code. Exploit brokers directly enable sophisticated attacks by
    providing initial access capabilities to actors who lack independent exploit development
    resources. Understanding this market is essential for predicting emerging attack vectors and
    assessing the evolving threat landscape.
