# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "CyberLink is a Taiwanese software company founded in 1996, primarily known for multimedia software products including PowerDirector (video editing), PowerDVD (media player), and FaceMe (AI facial recognition). While not a cybersecurity vendor, CyberLink is relevant to the security landscape because its software update mechanisms have been compromised in supply chain attacks, and its FaceMe facial recognition technology has security and privacy implications."
  why: "CyberLink is significant in the cybersecurity context due to its involvement in supply chain compromise incidents where threat actors trojanized CyberLink software updates to distribute malware. The 2023 Diamond Sleet supply chain attack targeting CyberLink's update infrastructure highlighted the risk of compromising trusted software vendors. Additionally, their FaceMe AI facial recognition technology raises biometric security and privacy concerns."
  how: "CyberLink distributes its software through traditional download and automatic update mechanisms. In supply chain attacks, threat actors compromised CyberLink's update infrastructure to insert malicious payloads into legitimately signed software updates, which were then distributed to end users through the trusted update channel. CyberLink's FaceMe technology uses deep learning for facial recognition across security, access control, and identity verification applications."
