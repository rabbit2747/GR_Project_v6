# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Star Blizzard, previously tracked as SEABORGIUM and Callisto Group, is a Russia-nexus advanced persistent threat group attributed to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Centre 18. Active since at least 2015, the group conducts persistent credential phishing campaigns targeting government officials, defense and intelligence consultants, journalists, think tank researchers, NGOs, and academics primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, and NATO member states."
  why: "Star Blizzard represents a persistent FSB-linked credential theft operation focused on collecting strategic intelligence from individuals with access to sensitive policy, defense, and intelligence information. The group's operations have been the subject of joint U.S.-UK government advisories and legal actions, including domain seizures by the U.S. Department of Justice, highlighting its significance as a state-sponsored espionage threat."
  how: "Star Blizzard conducts extensive open-source research on targets before initiating contact through carefully crafted impersonation emails from fake personas. The group builds trust through benign initial communications before sending credential phishing links to attacker-controlled login pages mimicking legitimate services like Microsoft, Google, and ProtonMail. Harvested credentials provide access to email accounts for intelligence collection. The group uses Evilginx-style adversary-in-the-middle frameworks to capture session tokens and bypass MFA."
