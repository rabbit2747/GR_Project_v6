definition:
  what: "JetBrains is a Czech software development company that produces integrated development environments (IDEs), build tools, and collaboration platforms used by millions of developers worldwide. Key products include IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, TeamCity (CI/CD server), and Space (development platform). In cybersecurity, JetBrains is significant due to the TeamCity supply chain attack vector exploited by Russian state-sponsored actors (SVR/Cozy Bear) in the SolarWinds campaign era, and ongoing critical vulnerabilities in TeamCity that have been targeted by threat actors."
  why: "JetBrains is relevant to cybersecurity as a critical component in software supply chains. TeamCity CI/CD servers are high-value targets because compromising them can enable supply chain attacks affecting all software built through those pipelines. Critical TeamCity vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2023-42793 and CVE-2024-27198) have been actively exploited by nation-state actors and ransomware groups, making JetBrains products important to monitor in enterprise security programs."
  how: "JetBrains develops and distributes software development tools through direct download, JetBrains Toolbox, and cloud-hosted services. TeamCity operates as a build automation and CI/CD server that orchestrates software compilation, testing, and deployment pipelines. Organizations use JetBrains products in development workflows where compromise could enable injection of malicious code into production software. JetBrains responds to security incidents through advisories, patches, and coordination with security researchers."
