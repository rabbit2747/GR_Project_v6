# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Evasive Panda (Daggerfly) is a Chinese APT group active since at least 2012, targeting telecommunications, government, NGOs, universities, and individuals across East and Southeast Asia, as well as diaspora communities worldwide. The group is notable for its sophisticated MgBot modular malware framework, supply chain compromise of legitimate software update mechanisms, and ISP-level attacks to redirect legitimate update traffic to deliver malware. In 2023-2024, the group compromised ISP infrastructure to conduct adversary-in-the-middle attacks on software updates."
  why: "Evasive Panda represents a significant escalation in Chinese APT capabilities through their ISP-level compromise and abuse of legitimate software update mechanisms. By hijacking update processes at the ISP level, the group can target broad populations or specific individuals without traditional phishing. Their targeting of Tibetan, Uyghur, and Taiwanese communities demonstrates the use of cyber operations for political surveillance of diaspora populations."
  how: "The group compromises ISP infrastructure to redirect legitimate software update requests (DNS poisoning/BGP hijacking), delivering trojanized updates containing the MgBot backdoor. MgBot is a modular framework supporting multiple plugins for keylogging, screen capture, audio recording, file theft, and browser credential extraction. The group also conducts watering hole attacks and supply chain compromise of legitimate Chinese software products. Recent operations include macOS and Linux variants of their toolset. They use custom code-signed malware and exploit legitimate applications for DLL sideloading."
