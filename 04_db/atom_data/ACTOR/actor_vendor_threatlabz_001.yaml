# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "ThreatLabZ is Zscaler's threat intelligence and security research division that analyzes over 500 billion daily transactions across Zscaler's global cloud security platform to identify emerging threats, malware campaigns, and attack techniques. The team produces detailed research on phishing campaigns, ransomware operations, zero-day exploits, and cloud-based attack vectors, publishing annual state-of-attack reports covering encrypted threats, ransomware, and phishing trends."
  why: "ThreatLabZ is significant because Zscaler's unique position as a cloud security proxy processing massive volumes of internet traffic provides unparalleled visibility into web-based threats, encrypted attack traffic, and cloud-native attack patterns. The team's research directly feeds into Zscaler's zero-trust platform protection and provides the security community with large-scale threat trend analysis that no other vendor can match."
  how: "ThreatLabZ operates by analyzing the enormous volume of traffic flowing through Zscaler's global cloud platform, applying machine learning models, behavioral analysis, and manual research to identify new threats. The team tracks threat actor campaigns, discovers zero-day vulnerabilities, and develops detection signatures that are deployed across Zscaler's platform in real time. Research findings are published through blog posts, annual reports, and conference presentations."
