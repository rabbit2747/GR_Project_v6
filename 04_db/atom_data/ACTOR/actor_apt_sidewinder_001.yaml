# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "SideWinder is an India-nexus advanced persistent threat group active since at least 2012 and considered one of the most prolific APT groups in terms of attack volume. The group primarily targets military and government entities in Pakistan, China, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. SideWinder has been observed conducting thousands of attacks, making it one of the highest-volume APT groups tracked by the security community."
  why: "SideWinder is significant due to its extremely high operational tempo, launching thousands of targeted attacks across South and Central Asian nations. Despite not being the most technically sophisticated group, its sheer volume of operations, focus on regional military intelligence, and continuous evolution of attack techniques make it a persistent threat to Pakistani and Chinese military and governmental organizations."
  how: "SideWinder primarily uses spear-phishing emails with malicious RTF and DOCX documents exploiting known vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-11882 (Equation Editor). The group deploys custom .NET-based malware, JavaScript-based first-stage implants, and DLL side-loading techniques. Recent operations have included mobile malware targeting Android devices. The group uses compromised websites for C2 and frequently updates its infrastructure. It leverages server-side polymorphism to generate unique payloads for each target."
