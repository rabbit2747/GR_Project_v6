# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Bendy Bear is a Chinese-linked APT activity cluster identified by CrowdStrike, associated with the WaterBear malware family and closely tied to the BlackTech threat group. The group targets government agencies, technology companies, and telecommunications organizations primarily in East Asia, with particular focus on Taiwan. Bendy Bear is notable for its highly sophisticated evasion techniques and use of modified shellcode loaders that operate entirely in memory."
  why: "Bendy Bear represents one of the most technically sophisticated Chinese APT operations, employing advanced anti-analysis and evasion techniques that make detection extremely difficult. The group's focus on Taiwanese government and technology targets aligns with strategic Chinese intelligence collection priorities, and their tradecraft demonstrates continuous evolution in bypassing modern security controls."
  how: "The group uses the WaterBear modular backdoor platform which loads shellcode directly into memory, avoiding disk-based indicators. The malware employs polymorphic code, API hashing, and encrypted communications to evade detection. Persistence is achieved through DLL side-loading and registry modifications. The modular architecture allows operators to dynamically load additional capabilities post-compromise, including keyloggers, screen capture, and file exfiltration modules."
