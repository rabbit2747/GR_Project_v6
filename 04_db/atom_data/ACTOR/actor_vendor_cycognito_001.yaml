# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "CyCognito is a cybersecurity vendor specializing in external attack surface management (EASM), providing automated discovery and testing of an organization's internet-facing assets. The platform continuously maps an organization's external attack surface from an attacker's perspective, identifying unknown assets, shadow IT, subsidiaries, and third-party exposures without requiring any internal access or agent deployment."
  why: "CyCognito is significant because organizations typically have limited visibility into their full external attack surface, including forgotten assets, shadow IT, and subsidiary infrastructure. By discovering and testing these assets from an attacker's perspective without requiring internal access, CyCognito helps organizations identify and remediate exposures before threat actors can exploit them."
  how: "CyCognito operates a platform that uses reconnaissance techniques similar to those used by attackers to discover an organization's external-facing assets through domain enumeration, certificate analysis, web crawling, and infrastructure fingerprinting. Once assets are discovered, the platform automatically tests them for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and exposures, prioritizing findings by business risk and exploitability."
