# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Project Sauron (also known as Strider) is a highly advanced cyber espionage platform discovered independently by Kaspersky and Symantec in 2016. The platform had been operating undetected since at least 2011, targeting government, military, telecommunications, financial, and scientific organizations in Russia, China, Iran, Rwanda, and other countries. The technical sophistication rivals or exceeds platforms like Equation Group, Regin, and Duqu."
  why: "Project Sauron was designed for long-term intelligence collection from the highest-value targets, including classified government networks and critical national infrastructure. The extreme sophistication, anti-forensics capabilities, and targeting of multiple nation-state adversaries (Russia, China, Iran) suggest a Western intelligence agency as the likely operator, though definitive public attribution has not been established."
  how: "The platform demonstrates extraordinary technical capabilities: each deployment uses a unique, customized implant that avoids signatures, modules reside exclusively in memory to evade disk forensics, data exfiltration from air-gapped networks via specially prepared USB drives using hidden partitions, exploitation of custom network protocols disguised as legitimate traffic, keylogging and credential theft targeting encryption key material, and the ability to operate within hardened network environments. The modular architecture supports over 50 different plugin types for various collection and evasion purposes."
  core_concepts:
    - "air-gapped network infiltration"
    - "memory-resident malware platform"
    - "unique-per-target deployment"
    - "multi-year undetected operations"
    - "nation-state level sophistication"
