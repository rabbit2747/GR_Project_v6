definition:
  what: "Tango Delta, most widely tracked as Transparent Tribe or APT36, is a Pakistan-nexus advanced persistent threat group active since at least 2013. The group primarily conducts cyber-espionage operations against Indian military and government entities, defense contractors, and educational institutions. Transparent Tribe has also targeted Afghan government officials and activists. The group is assessed to operate in support of Pakistani military intelligence objectives."
  why: "Tango Delta is one of the most persistent Pakistan-linked threat groups, representing a continuous espionage threat to Indian defense and government organizations. The group's operations directly support military intelligence collection regarding Indian military deployments, defense technologies, and strategic planning. Its expanding capabilities across Windows, Linux, and Android platforms demonstrate continuous investment in offensive operations."
  how: "Tango Delta delivers weaponized documents and malicious executables via spear-phishing emails themed around Indian military and government topics. The group's primary tool is CrimsonRAT, a custom .NET-based remote access trojan with extensive capabilities for keylogging, file exfiltration, and screen capture. It also deploys ObliqueRAT for Windows targets and CapraRAT for Android mobile surveillance. The group has used trojanized installers for legitimate applications and honey trap operations using fake social media personas to target military personnel."
