definition:
  what: >-
    Conti Leaks refers to the massive internal data breach of the Conti ransomware operation that
    occurred in February-March 2022 when a Ukrainian researcher, motivated by Conti's public support
    for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leaked tens of thousands of internal chat messages, source
    code, operational manuals, and infrastructure details. The Conti ransomware group (also tracked
    as Wizard Spider and Gold Ulrick) was one of the most prolific and damaging ransomware operations
    from 2020 to 2022, responsible for attacks on over 1,000 organizations including the Irish Health
    Service Executive (HSE), Costa Rican government, and numerous US healthcare and critical
    infrastructure targets. The leaked data provided unprecedented insight into the organizational
    structure, operational methods, salary structures, recruitment processes, and technical
    infrastructure of a major ransomware-as-a-service operation.
  why: >-
    The Conti Leaks represent the most significant intelligence disclosure about ransomware
    operations in cybersecurity history, fundamentally advancing the understanding of how major
    cybercriminal organizations operate. The leaks revealed Conti operated like a corporate entity
    with approximately 100-200 salaried employees organized into teams (developers, testers,
    negotiators, administrators, HR). The operational manuals exposed playbooks for network
    penetration, persistence, and ransomware deployment that continue to influence derivative groups.
    Following the leaks, Conti formally disbanded in May 2022, but its members scattered to form or
    join Black Basta, Royal/BlackSuit, Akira, Zeon, and other ransomware operations, making the
    Conti lineage central to understanding the current ransomware landscape.
  how: >-
    The Conti operation used TrickBot and BazarLoader for initial access through phishing campaigns,
    deploying Cobalt Strike beacons for command and control and lateral movement. Post-compromise
    techniques included Mimikatz for credential harvesting, BloodHound for Active Directory
    reconnaissance, PsExec and WMI for lateral movement, and Rclone for data exfiltration. The
    Conti ransomware encrypted files using AES-256 with RSA-4096 key wrapping and targeted both
    Windows systems and VMware ESXi hypervisors. The leaked materials revealed detailed attack
    playbooks including step-by-step instructions for exploiting Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472),
    PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527), and other vulnerabilities. The group operated a Tor-based
    leak site for double extortion and maintained dedicated negotiation infrastructure. The leak
    itself was published via ContiLeaks Twitter account and distributed through security research
    communities.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Ransomware Corporate Structure"
      value: >-
        The Conti Leaks revealed that major ransomware operations function as corporate entities
        with salaried employees, structured teams (development, testing, HR, negotiation), formal
        management hierarchies, and organizational processes that mirror legitimate technology
        companies.
    - key: "Ransomware Lineage and Fragmentation"
      value: >-
        Following the Conti dissolution in May 2022, its operators and affiliates dispersed to
        create or join Black Basta, Royal/BlackSuit, Akira, Zeon, Karakurt, and other operations,
        making the Conti ecosystem the single most important lineage in modern ransomware.
