# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "The White Company is a sophisticated APT group documented by Cylance (now BlackBerry) in their Operation Shaheen report, which revealed a cyber-espionage campaign primarily targeting the Pakistani Air Force and other Pakistani military and government entities. The group demonstrated advanced anti-analysis capabilities designed to evade specific security products and sandbox environments. The operation was named Shaheen after the Shaheen falcon, which is also the name of Pakistan's ballistic missile series."
  why: "The White Company and Operation Shaheen are significant for demonstrating highly targeted anti-detection techniques specifically designed to bypass particular security vendors' products. The group's focus on Pakistani military aviation and ballistic missile capabilities indicates state-sponsored intelligence collection on Pakistan's strategic military programs, suggesting operations by a nation-state adversary with specific interest in Pakistani defense capabilities."
  how: "The White Company deployed multi-stage infection chains initiated through spear-phishing with weaponized Office documents exploiting known vulnerabilities. The group incorporated sophisticated anti-analysis features that specifically checked for and evaded detection by eight named antivirus products. Malware used custom encoding and encryption, performed extensive environment checking to avoid sandboxes, and employed DLL side-loading for execution. The final payload provided remote access capabilities for intelligence collection on Pakistani military programs."
