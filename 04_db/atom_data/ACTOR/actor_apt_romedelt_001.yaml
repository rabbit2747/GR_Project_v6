# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Romeo Delta, also known as Patchwork or Dropping Elephant, is an India-nexus advanced persistent threat group active since at least 2015. The group primarily targets government agencies, military organizations, diplomatic entities, and think tanks in Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and other South Asian nations. Romeo Delta is notable for its practice of copying and combining code from various publicly available sources and other threat groups' tools, earning it the name Patchwork."
  why: "Romeo Delta is significant as one of the most active South Asian threat groups, demonstrating that APT operations do not require entirely bespoke tooling. The group's targeting patterns align with Indian strategic intelligence interests, particularly regarding neighboring nations' military capabilities, diplomatic positions, and defense activities. Despite using borrowed code, the group has demonstrated effective operational capabilities."
  how: "Romeo Delta delivers weaponized documents via spear-phishing using themes related to Pakistani military affairs, diplomatic communications, and regional politics. The group exploits known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office (particularly CVE-2017-0261 and CVE-2017-8570) and deploys a patchwork of tools including BADNEWS backdoor, QuasarRAT, and modified versions of publicly available malware. C2 communications often leverage compromised legitimate websites and legitimate cloud file hosting services."
