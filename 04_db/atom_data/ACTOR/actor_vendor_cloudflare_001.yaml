definition:
  what: "Cloudflare is a global network and security company founded in 2009, operating one of the world's largest CDN and DDoS mitigation networks spanning over 300 cities worldwide. Cloudflare provides web application firewall (WAF), DDoS protection, DNS security, bot management, zero trust network access (Cloudflare Access), secure web gateway, email security, and threat intelligence. The company also publishes threat research through Cloudflare Radar and its security blog."
  why: "Cloudflare is significant because its network sits in front of a substantial portion of the internet's web traffic, giving it unique visibility into global threat patterns, DDoS attack trends, and web application attacks. Their infrastructure provides a critical defense layer for millions of websites and APIs, and their threat intelligence and transparency reports contribute valuable data to the security community."
  how: "Cloudflare operates through its global anycast network that proxies web traffic, applying security policies at the edge before requests reach origin servers. The platform provides WAF rules, rate limiting, bot detection, DDoS mitigation at layers 3/4/7, DNS filtering, and zero trust access controls. Cloudflare Workers enables serverless edge computing. Their threat intelligence is derived from analyzing traffic across their entire network."
