# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "ConnectWise is a software company providing IT management and remote access solutions primarily for managed service providers (MSPs). Their products include ConnectWise ScreenConnect (remote access/support), ConnectWise Automate (remote monitoring and management), and ConnectWise SIEM for security monitoring. ConnectWise tools are widely deployed across the MSP ecosystem to manage and support client IT environments remotely."
  why: "ConnectWise is significant in the cybersecurity context because its remote access tools, particularly ScreenConnect, have become frequent targets and vectors for cyberattacks. Threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in ConnectWise products or abuse legitimate ScreenConnect instances for unauthorized remote access during ransomware campaigns. The MSP supply chain is a high-value target, and ConnectWise's position as a dominant MSP platform makes it a critical infrastructure component."
  how: "ConnectWise provides remote access through ScreenConnect agents deployed on managed endpoints, remote monitoring through Automate agents, and security monitoring through their SIEM product. MSPs use these tools for client system administration, patch management, and support. Security vulnerabilities in these tools can provide attackers with access to thousands of downstream client environments through a single compromised MSP."
