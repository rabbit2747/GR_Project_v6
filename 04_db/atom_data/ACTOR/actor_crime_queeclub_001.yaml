  what: >-
    Queen of Clubs is a cybercriminal group operating in the carding and financial fraud ecosystem,
    specializing in the acquisition, validation, and resale of stolen payment card data, compromised
    online banking credentials, and personally identifiable information (PII). The group operates
    through dark web carding forums and marketplaces, providing curated and validated stolen financial
    data to other cybercriminals for fraudulent transactions. Queen of Clubs is also associated with
    web skimming (Magecart-style) operations that inject malicious JavaScript into e-commerce
    websites to harvest payment card data in real-time as customers enter their information during
    checkout. The group serves as both an operator conducting direct attacks and a marketplace
    reseller aggregating data from multiple sources.
  why: >-
    Queen of Clubs represents the organized carding and payment fraud segment of the cybercriminal
    ecosystem that directly impacts consumers, merchants, and financial institutions. Carding
    operations cause billions of dollars in annual losses globally, with stolen card data being one
    of the most traded commodities on dark web marketplaces. The group's Magecart-style web skimming
    operations pose particular risks to e-commerce businesses, as injected skimmer scripts can
    operate undetected for weeks or months, harvesting thousands of payment cards before discovery.
    The professionalization of carding operations, with quality controls, customer support, and
    refund guarantees for invalid cards, has lowered barriers to entry for financial fraud and
    increased the reliability of stolen data markets.
  how: >-
    Queen of Clubs conducts web skimming attacks by compromising e-commerce websites through
    exploitation of vulnerabilities in content management systems (Magento, WooCommerce, PrestaShop),
    third-party JavaScript libraries, and supply chain compromises of payment processing scripts.
    Injected skimmer JavaScript intercepts payment card data, billing addresses, and personal
    information during checkout and exfiltrates it to attacker-controlled collection servers.
    Harvested card data is validated through small-value test transactions to verify card
    availability before being listed on dark web carding marketplaces. The group also acquires
    stolen data from other breach operators, validates and categorizes it by card type, issuing
    bank, and geographic region, then resells through curated listings. Communication and sales
    are conducted through dark web forums (Joker's Stash successors), Telegram channels, and
    encrypted messaging. Pricing varies based on card type, freshness, and available balance.
