definition:
  what: >-
    Carbanak (also known as Anunak) is one of the most sophisticated and financially successful
    cybercriminal groups in history, first documented by Kaspersky Lab in 2015. The group targeted
    banks and financial institutions worldwide between 2013 and 2018, stealing an estimated $1
    billion or more through direct manipulation of banking systems, ATM networks, and financial
    transaction infrastructure. Unlike typical banking trojans that target customers, Carbanak
    directly infiltrated bank internal networks, compromised SWIFT terminals, manipulated account
    balances, and controlled ATM dispensers to withdraw cash on demand. The group's operations
    demonstrated nation-state-level sophistication applied to purely financial crime, with campaigns
    affecting over 100 financial institutions across 40 countries. There is significant operational
    overlap between Carbanak and the FIN7 cybercriminal group.
  why: >-
    Carbanak fundamentally changed the threat landscape for the financial sector by demonstrating
    that cybercriminals could directly compromise and manipulate core banking infrastructure for
    theft at unprecedented scale. The group's estimated $1 billion in theft from financial
    institutions represented a paradigm shift from targeting individual customers to attacking
    the banks themselves. Kaspersky's 2015 report on Carbanak was a landmark in cybersecurity
    research, revealing the sophistication and organizational capability of cybercriminal groups.
    The arrest of the alleged Carbanak leader in Alicante, Spain in March 2018 through a joint
    Europol/FBI/Spanish Police operation was a major law enforcement achievement. The tools,
    techniques, and operational model developed by Carbanak influenced subsequent financially
    motivated cybercriminal groups including FIN7 and others.
  how: >-
    Carbanak attacks began with spear-phishing emails targeting bank employees, delivering malicious
    Office documents with embedded exploits or macro-based payloads that installed the Carbanak
    backdoor. Once inside bank networks, the group conducted extensive reconnaissance over weeks to
    months, studying internal banking processes, video-recording employee screens via the backdoor's
    surveillance capabilities, and mapping the financial infrastructure. The Carbanak backdoor
    provided remote access, keystroke logging, screen capture, and file transfer capabilities
    through encrypted C2 channels. Money theft was accomplished through three primary methods:
    (1) Direct ATM cash-out by sending commands to ATM controllers to dispense cash at predetermined
    times and locations, (2) SWIFT network manipulation to transfer funds to accounts controlled by
    the group, and (3) Inflation of account balances followed by transfer of the excess to mule
    accounts. The group used extensive anti-forensic techniques and maintained persistent access
    for extended periods.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Banking Infrastructure Compromise"
      value: >-
        Carbanak pioneered the approach of directly compromising bank internal systems rather
        than targeting customers, manipulating core banking applications, ATM controllers, and
        SWIFT terminals to conduct theft at institutional scale.
    - key: "Patient Network Reconnaissance"
      value: >-
        The group invested weeks to months studying compromised bank networks, video-recording
        employee activities, and mapping financial processes before executing theft, demonstrating
        an operational patience that maximized the return on each compromise.
