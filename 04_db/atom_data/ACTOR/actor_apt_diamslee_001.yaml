# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Diamond Sleet (formerly ZINC) is a North Korean state-sponsored APT group tracked by Microsoft, operating within the broader Lazarus Group ecosystem. The group targets media, defense, IT, and technology sectors worldwide for both espionage and financial theft. Diamond Sleet is notable for conducting software supply chain attacks, including the compromise of CyberLink (2023) and 3CX (2023), and for targeting security researchers through fake social media personas and trojanized security tools."
  why: "Diamond Sleet is significant for their sophisticated supply chain compromise capabilities, having successfully trojanized widely-used software products to distribute malware to downstream users. Their targeting of security researchers is particularly noteworthy as it attempts to compromise the very defenders tasked with detecting North Korean operations. The group combines espionage objectives with financial theft, supporting dual North Korean state objectives."
  how: "The group conducts software supply chain attacks by compromising software vendors' build processes to distribute trojanized updates. They create fake social media profiles impersonating security researchers to build trust and deliver exploits or malware to real researchers. Diamond Sleet uses trojanized open-source tools and develops weaponized PuTTY, KiTTY, and other utilities. Custom malware includes BLINDINGCAN, ZetaNile, and FoggyBrass. The group also weaponizes legitimate VPN clients and PDF readers with embedded backdoors."
