# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Noble Baron is a designation associated with APT29/Cozy Bear/Midnight Blizzard, the Russian SVR (Foreign Intelligence Service) cyber espionage group. Active since at least 2008, this is one of the most sophisticated state-sponsored threat actors globally, responsible for the SolarWinds supply chain compromise (2020), persistent targeting of cloud environments, and long-running espionage campaigns against government, diplomatic, think tank, and technology sector targets worldwide."
  why: "The group serves Russian SVR foreign intelligence collection requirements, targeting diplomatic communications, foreign policy deliberations, COVID-19 vaccine research, technology sector intellectual property, and strategic political intelligence. Their operations support Russia's understanding of adversary policies and decision-making processes, with particular focus on NATO member states and organizations involved in Russia-related policy."
  how: "Noble Baron/APT29 is distinguished by exceptional operational security and technical sophistication. Notable techniques include supply chain compromise (SolarWinds Orion), abuse of cloud service trust relationships and OAuth applications, residential proxy networks for C2, custom malware families (WellMess, WellMail, EnvyScout, SUNBURST), living-off-the-land techniques in cloud environments, and patient long-term access maintenance. The group has pioneered techniques for abusing Microsoft 365 and Azure AD trust relationships."
