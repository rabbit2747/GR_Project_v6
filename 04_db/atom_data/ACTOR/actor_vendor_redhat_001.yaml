definition:
  what: "Red Hat is a leading enterprise open-source software company, acquired by IBM in 2019, best known for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), OpenShift container platform, and Ansible automation. In cybersecurity, Red Hat is significant as the maintainer of the most widely deployed enterprise Linux distribution, operating the Red Hat Product Security team that manages CVE assignments, security advisories (RHSA), and vulnerability response for the RHEL ecosystem. Red Hat also provides security-focused products including Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security and SELinux."
  why: "Red Hat is critically important in cybersecurity because RHEL is the foundation of enterprise server infrastructure worldwide, and its security posture directly impacts millions of production systems. Red Hat's security advisories and patch releases drive Linux vulnerability management across enterprises. Their contributions to SELinux, container security through OpenShift, and Kubernetes security standards significantly influence how organizations secure Linux and container workloads."
  how: "Red Hat provides security through the Product Security team that triages vulnerabilities, assigns CVEs, and publishes Red Hat Security Advisories with patches for RHEL and related products. SELinux provides mandatory access control for Linux systems. OpenShift includes built-in container security features including image scanning, network policies, and security context constraints. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (formerly StackRox) provides Kubernetes-native security. Red Hat Insights provides vulnerability management and compliance scanning for RHEL environments."
