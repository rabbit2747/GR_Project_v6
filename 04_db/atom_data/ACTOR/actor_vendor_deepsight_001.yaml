# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "DeepSight is a threat intelligence service originally developed by Symantec (now Broadcom), providing curated threat intelligence data feeds, vulnerability intelligence, and adversary analysis. DeepSight aggregates telemetry from Symantec's extensive sensor network to deliver actionable intelligence on malware, vulnerabilities, IP reputation, and threat actor campaigns to security operations teams."
  why: "DeepSight is significant as one of the original enterprise threat intelligence services, leveraging Symantec's massive global sensor network that processes billions of security events daily. The service provides organizations with curated, actionable intelligence feeds that can be integrated into SIEM, firewall, and security orchestration platforms to enhance detection and response capabilities."
  how: "DeepSight collects and correlates telemetry from Symantec's global sensor network including endpoint agents, email gateways, web proxies, and intrusion detection systems. Analysts curate this data into threat intelligence feeds covering malicious IPs, URLs, file hashes, vulnerability data, and threat actor profiles. These feeds are delivered via APIs and integrations for consumption by security tools."
