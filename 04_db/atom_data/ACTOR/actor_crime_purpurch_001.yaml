definition:
  what: >-
    Purple Urchin (also tracked as Automated Libra by Palo Alto Unit 42) is a South African-based
    cybercriminal group that conducts large-scale freejacking and cryptojacking operations by
    abusing free-tier and trial cloud service accounts on platforms including GitHub, Heroku,
    Togglebox, and other cloud providers. The group uses automated account creation at massive
    scale, registering thousands of accounts using stolen or fabricated identities and CAPTCHA
    bypass services to deploy cryptocurrency mining workloads. Purple Urchin's operations were
    documented creating over 130,000 accounts across multiple platforms between 2022 and 2023,
    using the free compute resources to mine cryptocurrencies including Monero, Tidecoin, and
    other proof-of-work coins. The group's operations represent one of the largest documented
    freejacking campaigns in cloud platform history.
  why: >-
    Purple Urchin demonstrates a significant and growing threat to cloud service providers from
    large-scale resource abuse. The group's automated exploitation of free-tier cloud services
    imposes substantial financial costs on cloud providers who must absorb the compute costs of
    fraudulent accounts. The scale of Purple Urchin's operations, with over 130,000 accounts,
    highlights the inadequacy of current cloud platform identity verification and fraud detection
    mechanisms. Their operations also demonstrate how cryptocurrency mining provides a direct
    monetization path for stolen cloud compute resources without requiring victim interaction.
    The group's use of automated CAPTCHA solving, disposable email addresses, and identity
    fabrication at scale represents a template that other cybercriminal groups can replicate
    for various cloud abuse scenarios beyond cryptomining.
  how: >-
    Purple Urchin employs a highly automated pipeline for cloud resource theft. The operation
    begins with mass account creation using automated scripts that generate thousands of accounts
    on cloud platforms, utilizing CAPTCHA bypass services, temporary email addresses, and sometimes
    stolen identity documents for verification. Each account is configured with CI/CD pipelines
    (GitHub Actions), containers (Heroku dynos), or virtual machines that execute cryptocurrency
    mining software. The group uses custom orchestration tools to manage thousands of concurrent
    mining instances, rotate accounts as they are detected and suspended, and aggregate mining
    proceeds through cryptocurrency wallets. Mining operations primarily target Monero (XMR) using
    XMRig and other mining software, as well as smaller proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. The group
    uses proxy networks and VPN services to distribute account creation across multiple IP
    addresses, evading platform-level fraud detection. Proceeds are laundered through privacy
    coins and mixing services.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Freejacking at Scale"
      value: >-
        Purple Urchin pioneered the large-scale abuse of free-tier cloud services for cryptocurrency
        mining, creating over 130,000 accounts to exploit free compute resources, demonstrating
        the vulnerability of cloud provider trial and free-tier programs to automated abuse.
    - key: "Automated Cloud Account Farming"
      value: >-
        The group developed sophisticated automation for mass account creation across multiple
        cloud platforms, utilizing CAPTCHA bypass services, disposable emails, and fabricated
        identities to evade platform-level fraud detection.
