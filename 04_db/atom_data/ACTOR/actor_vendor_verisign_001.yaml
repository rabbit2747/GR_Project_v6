definition:
  what: "VeriSign is a critical internet infrastructure company operating the authoritative registry for .com and .net top-level domains and two of the thirteen DNS root name servers.

The company's DNS operations are essential for domain name resolution, and any compromise or disruption would have catastrophic consequences for internet connectivity. VeriSign's iDefense service was a pioneering commercial threat intelligence platform, and the company's security research has contributed to understanding DNS-based threats."
  how: "VeriSign operates through globally distributed DNS infrastructure using Anycast technology to provide resilient, high-performance domain name resolution. The company maintains the .com and .net zone files, processes domain registrations through accredited registrars, and provides DDoS mitigation services.
