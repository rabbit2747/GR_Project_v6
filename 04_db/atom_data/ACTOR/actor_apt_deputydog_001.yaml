# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "DeputyDog (APT17) is a Chinese APT group active since at least 2013, attributed to operations targeting U.S. government entities, defense contractors, law firms, information technology companies, mining companies, and non-governmental organizations. The group gained prominence through its use of Internet Explorer zero-day exploits (CVE-2013-3893) and was later linked to the compromise of an IT security company's website used as a watering hole. APT17 is known for hosting command-and-control profiles on legitimate platforms such as Microsoft TechNet forums."
  why: "DeputyDog is significant for demonstrating innovative C2 techniques, particularly the use of legitimate websites and forums as dead-drop resolvers for command-and-control communications. By embedding encoded C2 addresses within legitimate forum profiles, the group made network-level detection extremely difficult. Their targeting of law firms and IT security companies demonstrates Chinese intelligence interest in legal proceedings and cybersecurity capabilities of adversaries."
  how: "The group used watering hole attacks exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer to compromise targets visiting specific websites. They deployed custom backdoors including BLACKCOFFEE, which retrieved C2 server addresses from encoded strings embedded in profiles on Microsoft TechNet and other legitimate forums (dead-drop resolver technique). Additional tooling included 9002 RAT and variants for persistent access. The group also conducted spearphishing operations with malicious attachments targeting specific organizations."
