# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Operation Triangulation is a highly sophisticated zero-click iOS exploit campaign discovered by Kaspersky in June 2023 that targeted iPhones through invisible iMessage messages. The campaign exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities in the iOS operating system including a hardware-level vulnerability in an undocumented Apple hardware feature, representing one of the most technically advanced mobile exploitation chains ever publicly documented. The campaign targeted Kaspersky employees and other high-value individuals."
  why: "The campaign targeted specific individuals with intelligence value, including cybersecurity researchers at Kaspersky. The sophistication of the exploit chain, particularly the exploitation of an undocumented hardware feature, suggests a well-resourced state-sponsored actor with deep knowledge of Apple hardware architecture. The intelligence objectives likely included surveillance of targeted individuals' communications, contacts, and device data."
  how: "The attack chain was entirely zero-click, requiring no user interaction. An invisible iMessage attachment triggered exploitation of four zero-day vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-41990 (TrueType font instruction vulnerability), CVE-2023-32434 (kernel integer overflow), CVE-2023-32435 (WebKit memory corruption), and CVE-2023-38606 (exploitation of undocumented MMIO hardware registers). The final payload, TriangleDB, is a full-featured spyware implant with capabilities for microphone recording, photo collection, geolocation tracking, keychain access, and database extraction. The exploit chain operated entirely in memory, leaving minimal forensic traces."
