# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Grizzly Steppe is a US government codename for a combined set of Russian malicious cyber operations attributed to the Russian civilian intelligence service (FSB, associated with APT29/Cozy Bear) and military intelligence service (GRU, associated with APT28/Fancy Bear), most notably targeting US political organizations and election infrastructure during 2015-2016."
  why: "The campaign was conducted to influence the 2016 US presidential election, steal sensitive political strategy documents, and undermine public confidence in the democratic process. Intelligence assessments indicate the operations served Russian strategic interests by sowing discord and gathering political intelligence."
  how: "The operation employed a multi-phase approach: APT29 initially compromised the Democratic National Committee (DNC) network via spear-phishing in summer 2015, while APT28 independently compromised the same network in spring 2016. Techniques included spear-phishing emails with malicious links, credential harvesting, deployment of custom implants (COZY DUKE, X-Agent, X-Tunnel, SeaDaddy), lateral movement through domain controllers, and large-scale data exfiltration."

  embedding_text: "Grizzly Steppe is the US government designation for combined Russian malicious cyber activity attributed to the FSB (APT29/Cozy Bear) and GRU (APT28/Fancy Bear). The operation targeted US political organizations, most prominently the Democratic National Committee, during 2015-2016 to collect political intelligence and influence the presidential election. Attack methods included spear-phishing, credential harvesting, custom malware deployment including COZY DUKE and X-Agent implants, lateral movement through Windows domain infrastructure, and large-scale exfiltration of emails and documents. The joint assessment report JAR-16-20296A published by DHS and FBI in December 2016 formally attributed these activities to Russian intelligence services and documented indicators of compromise. Grizzly Steppe represents one of the most significant documented cases of state-sponsored cyber operations targeting democratic processes."
