# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "OceanLotus (also known as APT32, Canvas Cyclone, and BISMUTH) is a Vietnamese state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2012. The group targets private sector companies, dissidents, journalists, foreign governments, and organizations with interests in Vietnam, particularly in Southeast Asia but also extending to Europe and North America."
  why: "OceanLotus operations serve Vietnamese government intelligence priorities including monitoring political dissidents and journalists critical of the Vietnamese government, collecting intelligence on foreign government policies affecting Vietnam, conducting economic espionage against automotive, hospitality, and technology companies, and surveilling human rights activists and civil society organizations."
  how: "The group uses sophisticated spear-phishing campaigns with highly targeted social engineering, watering hole attacks on websites frequented by targets, and custom malware for both Windows and macOS platforms. Notable tools include Denis/Cobalt Kitty backdoor, KerrDown, Ratsnif, and custom macOS backdoors. OceanLotus demonstrates advanced techniques including steganography for payload delivery, living-off-the-land binaries, and abuse of legitimate cloud services. They have developed sophisticated macOS malware delivered through fake application installers and watering hole frameworks."
