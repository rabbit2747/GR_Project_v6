# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "DarkVishnya is a financially motivated threat operation discovered by Kaspersky in 2018, targeting banks in Eastern Europe through physical intrusion. The attackers physically planted rogue devices -- including cheap single-board computers (Bash Bunnies, Raspberry Pi devices), USB-connected netbooks, or 4G-connected devices -- directly into bank branch networks by posing as couriers, maintenance workers, or visitors. These devices provided remote access to the internal bank network from which attackers conducted lateral movement and financial theft."
  why: "DarkVishnya is significant because it demonstrates the insider threat and physical access attack vector against financial institutions. By physically planting network-connected devices inside bank branches, attackers bypassed all perimeter security controls. This operation highlights the critical importance of physical security, network access control, and rogue device detection in financial institutions and other high-security environments."
  how: "Attackers gained physical access to bank branches through social engineering, posing as authorized visitors. They connected small computing devices (Bash Bunny, Raspberry Pi, or netbooks) to the local network via Ethernet ports or USB connections. These devices established reverse tunnels or 4G connections to external command-and-control servers, providing remote access to the internal network. From this position, attackers used Impacket, Responder, and other network tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement to reach financial systems and ATM infrastructure for fraudulent transactions."
