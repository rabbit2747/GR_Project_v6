# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "VerSprite is a cybersecurity consultancy specializing in penetration testing, threat modeling, application security, and risk-based security assessment. The company developed the PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) threat modeling methodology, a risk-centric framework that aligns threat analysis with business objectives and attacker perspectives to provide contextualized security assessment and prioritization."
  why: "VerSprite is significant in cybersecurity because the PASTA threat modeling methodology represents an important contribution to the discipline of structured threat analysis. Unlike asset-centric approaches, PASTA provides an attacker-centric, risk-based framework that helps organizations prioritize security investments based on realistic threat scenarios and business impact assessment."
  how: "VerSprite operates through security consulting services that apply the PASTA methodology alongside traditional penetration testing and application security assessments. The PASTA framework guides organizations through seven stages: defining objectives, defining technical scope, application decomposition, threat analysis, vulnerability analysis, attack modeling, and risk/impact analysis, producing actionable security recommendations aligned with business risk."
