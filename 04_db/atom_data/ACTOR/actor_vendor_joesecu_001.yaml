definition:
  what: "Joe Security is a Swiss cybersecurity company that develops Joe Sandbox, an advanced automated malware analysis platform. Joe Sandbox provides deep malware analysis through dynamic and static analysis across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS environments. The platform generates comprehensive behavioral reports including process activity, network communications, file system changes, registry modifications, and MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping for analyzed samples."
  why: "Joe Security is important in cybersecurity because Joe Sandbox is one of the most widely used malware analysis platforms by SOC analysts, incident responders, and threat intelligence teams. The platform's detailed behavioral analysis reports are frequently referenced in threat research publications and help organizations understand malware capabilities, extract indicators of compromise, and develop detection rules for emerging threats."
  how: "Joe Sandbox operates by executing suspicious files and URLs in controlled virtual and physical environments while monitoring all system interactions. The platform captures detailed behavioral data including API calls, network traffic, dropped files, and process trees. Analysis results are presented in comprehensive reports with MITRE ATT&CK mapping, YARA rule matching, and Sigma rule correlation. Joe Sandbox offers cloud-based and on-premise deployment options with API integration for automated analysis workflows."
