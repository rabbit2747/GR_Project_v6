# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Blotchy Quasar is a Russian-aligned threat activity cluster tracked by Recorded Future as TAG-110, believed to overlap with the UAC-0063 activity set tracked by CERT-UA. The group targets government entities, diplomatic missions, research institutions, and defense organizations in Central Asia, East Asia, and Europe. They are known for deploying custom .NET-based malware families including HatVibe and CherrySpy for espionage operations."
  why: "Blotchy Quasar is significant as a Russian-aligned espionage operation focused on Central Asian countries and their diplomatic relationships. The group's targeting of government and research entities in post-Soviet states and neighboring regions suggests intelligence collection priorities aligned with Russian geopolitical interests in maintaining influence across its near-abroad region."
  how: "The group uses spearphishing emails with malicious document attachments that deploy the HatVibe loader, a .NET-based malware that establishes initial persistence and downloads secondary payloads. CherrySpy, a Python-based backdoor, is used for sustained access and data exfiltration. The group leverages legitimate web services for command-and-control and employs scheduled tasks and registry run keys for persistence."
