# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "WindShift (also written as WinDShift) is a threat actor group identified by DarkMatter and later researched by Objective-See and others, known for conducting targeted cyber-espionage operations primarily against individuals in the Middle East. The group has also been linked to the broader Bahamut threat actor cluster. WindShift is notable for its rare capability to target macOS systems alongside mobile platforms, deploying custom macOS malware in espionage operations against government officials, activists, and journalists."
  why: "WindShift is significant as one of the few APT groups demonstrating dedicated macOS targeting capabilities in espionage operations. The group's focus on individual targets in the Middle East, including government officials and human rights activists, highlights the use of cyber-surveillance in the region. WindShift's operations overlap with Bahamut, suggesting a broader network of Middle Eastern cyber-espionage activity."
  how: "WindShift conducts credential phishing attacks using fake login pages for popular email and cloud services. The group deploys custom macOS malware including the WindTail backdoor family, which is delivered through phishing emails and malicious websites. For mobile targets, the group uses fake applications and MDM (Mobile Device Management) profiles for iOS surveillance. WindShift leverages DNS infrastructure for C2 communications and has demonstrated the ability to exploit macOS security features and Gatekeeper bypass techniques."
