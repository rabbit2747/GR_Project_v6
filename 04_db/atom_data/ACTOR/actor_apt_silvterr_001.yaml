# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Silver Terrier is a collective designation used by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 to track a large cluster of Nigerian cybercriminal threat actors conducting business email compromise (BEC), credential phishing, and malware distribution campaigns. The collective encompasses hundreds of individual actors and groups operating from Nigeria, responsible for billions of dollars in financial losses globally. Silver Terrier actors target organizations across all industries worldwide with sophisticated social engineering and commodity malware."
  why: "Silver Terrier represents one of the most financially impactful cyber threat ecosystems globally, with BEC attacks causing over $50 billion in cumulative losses according to FBI estimates. The collective's sophistication has evolved from simple advance-fee fraud to technically complex operations involving commodity RATs, credential harvesting, and man-in-the-mailbox attacks. The scale and financial impact make Nigerian BEC operations one of the highest-priority cybercrime threats."
  how: "Silver Terrier actors employ business email compromise schemes including CEO fraud, invoice manipulation, and payroll diversion. They use spear-phishing emails to deliver commodity malware such as Agent Tesla, LokiBot, Pony, ISRStealer, and NanoCore RAT for credential harvesting. Compromised email accounts are used for man-in-the-mailbox attacks to intercept and redirect financial transactions. The actors leverage free or low-cost email services, bulletproof hosting, and VPN services for operational infrastructure."
