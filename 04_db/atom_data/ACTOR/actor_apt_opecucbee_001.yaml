# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Operation Cuckoo Bees is a long-running Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage campaign uncovered by Cybereason in 2022, attributed to the Winnti Group (APT41). The operation targeted technology and manufacturing companies in North America, Europe, and Asia to steal intellectual property, trade secrets, and sensitive business data. The campaign had been running undetected for years, demonstrating exceptional stealth and persistence."
  why: "The operation served Chinese economic espionage objectives, systematically stealing intellectual property and trade secrets from technology and manufacturing companies to support Chinese industrial competitiveness. Targets included defense technology, pharmaceutical research, energy technology, and advanced manufacturing processes, aligning with Chinese strategic industrial development priorities."
  how: "The campaign exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing applications for initial access, then deployed a sophisticated chain of custom malware including DEPLOYLOG, Spyder Loader, PRIVATELOG, and WINNKIT bootkit. Attackers abused Windows CLFS (Common Log File System) for stealthy data storage, used WMI event subscriptions and scheduled tasks for persistence, conducted extensive Active Directory reconnaissance, and exfiltrated data through encrypted channels. The operation demonstrated advanced techniques for evading EDR solutions and maintaining long-term undetected access."
  core_concepts:
    - "Winnti Group long-term espionage"
    - "intellectual property theft at scale"
    - "CLFS log file abuse"
    - "bootkit-level persistence"
    - "multi-year undetected access"

The operation served Chinese economic espionage objectives supporting industrial competitiveness in defense technology, pharmaceuticals, energy, and advanced manufacturing. Operation Cuckoo Bees represents one of the most significant documented cases of sustained intellectual property theft attributed to Chinese state-sponsored actors."
