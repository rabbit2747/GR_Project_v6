# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Microsoft Security Intelligence, operating primarily through the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and related teams, is Microsoft's dedicated threat intelligence and security research organization. MSTIC tracks nation-state threat actors using Microsoft's weather-themed naming taxonomy (Midnight Blizzard, Forest Blizzard, etc.), publishes detailed campaign analysis, discovers zero-day vulnerabilities, and provides threat intelligence that feeds into Microsoft's security products and public advisories."
  why: "Microsoft Security Intelligence is one of the most influential threat intelligence organizations globally due to its unparalleled visibility into the threat landscape through telemetry from billions of Windows endpoints, Azure cloud instances, Office 365 accounts, and Defender installations. Their APT tracking and campaign disclosure directly shapes industry threat models, attribution, and defensive priorities. MSTIC's renamed threat actor taxonomy has become a widely referenced standard."
  how: "MSTIC leverages Microsoft's massive telemetry base spanning over 65 trillion daily security signals from endpoints, cloud, email, and identity systems to detect and track threat actor campaigns. The team publishes detailed reports through the Microsoft Security Blog, coordinates with government agencies and industry partners, contributes to MITRE ATT&CK framework, and integrates intelligence into Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence products. They maintain dedicated tracking of nation-state, cybercriminal, and hacktivist groups."
