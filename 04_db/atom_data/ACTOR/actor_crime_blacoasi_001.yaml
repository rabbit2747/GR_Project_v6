definition:
  what: >-
    Black Oasis is a threat actor tracked by Kaspersky since 2015 that is notable for its use of
    commercially available surveillance software and zero-day exploits in Adobe Flash Player to
    conduct targeted espionage operations. The group deployed the FinFisher (also known as FinSpy)
    commercial spyware suite developed by Gamma Group as its primary post-exploitation tool. Black
    Oasis was responsible for exploiting at least five Adobe Flash zero-day vulnerabilities between
    2015 and 2017, including CVE-2017-11292, CVE-2016-4117, CVE-2016-0984, CVE-2015-5119, and
    CVE-2015-5122. Targets included political figures, UN officials, opposition bloggers, and
    activists primarily in the Middle East, with victims also identified in Russia, the United
    Kingdom, Afghanistan, and other countries.
  why: >-
    Black Oasis represents the convergence of commercial surveillance tools and zero-day
    exploitation capabilities, highlighting the threat posed by the commercial spyware market to
    civil society, journalists, and political dissidents. The group's repeated acquisition and
    deployment of Flash Player zero-days demonstrates access to sophisticated exploit supply chains,
    either through internal development or purchase from exploit brokers. Their exclusive use of
    FinFisher/FinSpy, a tool marketed to government and law enforcement agencies, suggests potential
    state-sponsored or state-adjacent motivation. The group's targeting pattern of political
    dissidents, activists, and journalists in the Middle East aligns with authoritarian surveillance
    objectives.
  how: >-
    Black Oasis delivered exploits primarily through spear-phishing emails containing Microsoft
    Office documents with embedded Adobe Flash objects that triggered zero-day vulnerabilities.
    The exploit chain typically involved a Flash SWF file embedded in an Office document that,
    when opened, exploited the Flash vulnerability to achieve code execution and deploy the
    FinFisher/FinSpy implant. FinFisher provided comprehensive surveillance capabilities including
    keystroke logging, screen capture, microphone and webcam activation, file exfiltration, and
    encrypted command-and-control communication. The group's command-and-control infrastructure
    used multi-hop proxy networks to obscure attribution. Kaspersky discovered CVE-2017-11292
    through their analysis of Black Oasis operations, demonstrating how threat intelligence
    research can identify active zero-day exploitation.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Commercial Spyware Deployment"
      value: >-
        Black Oasis exclusively deployed FinFisher/FinSpy, a commercial surveillance tool sold by
        Gamma Group to government agencies, demonstrating how commercially available spyware enables
        sophisticated surveillance operations against civil society targets.
    - key: "Flash Zero-Day Exploitation"
      value: >-
        The group exploited at least five Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerabilities between 2015
        and 2017, indicating sustained access to high-value exploit capabilities either through
        internal research or procurement from exploit brokers.

    Black Oasis is a threat actor tracked by Kaspersky since 2015 that deploys FinFisher/FinSpy

    with Office documents containing embedded Flash exploits that deploy the FinFisher implant for
    comprehensive surveillance including keystroke logging, screen capture, and microphone activation.
    The group's use of commercially available Gamma Group spyware suggests state-sponsored or

    zero-day exploitation capabilities that threatens civil society and press freedom.
