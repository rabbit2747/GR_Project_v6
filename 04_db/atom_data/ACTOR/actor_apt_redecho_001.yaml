# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Red Echo is a China-linked advanced persistent threat group identified by Recorded Future's Insikt Group, notable for targeting Indian critical infrastructure including power grid operators, power generation facilities, and port authorities. The group was first publicly reported in early 2021 and is assessed to operate in support of Chinese strategic objectives in the Indo-Pacific region."
  why: "Red Echo represents a critical threat to national infrastructure security due to its specific targeting of electrical power systems and critical infrastructure in India. The group's activities raised concerns about pre-positioning for potential disruptive or destructive operations against power grid systems during periods of geopolitical tension between China and India."
  how: "Red Echo deployed ShadowPad malware, a modular backdoor associated with multiple Chinese APT groups, to establish persistent access within Indian power sector organizations. The group compromised internet-facing assets and leveraged command-and-control infrastructure overlapping with known Chinese state-sponsored groups. Operations involved targeting operational technology networks adjacent to IT environments within critical infrastructure organizations."
