# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Cozy Bear (APT29) is a Russian state-sponsored APT group attributed to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Active since at least 2008, the group is one of the most sophisticated and persistent cyber-espionage operations in the world. Cozy Bear was responsible for the SolarWinds supply chain compromise (2020), breaches of the Democratic National Committee (2016), numerous European government intrusions, and the 2023 Microsoft corporate email compromise. The group targets government, diplomatic, think tank, healthcare, and technology organizations worldwide."
  why: "Cozy Bear represents the highest tier of state-sponsored cyber-espionage capability. The SolarWinds compromise demonstrated the group's ability to conduct supply chain attacks affecting thousands of organizations simultaneously. Their persistent targeting of government email systems and cloud infrastructure, combined with exceptional operational security and continuously evolving tradecraft, makes APT29 one of the most significant strategic cyber threats to Western governments and institutions."
  how: "The group employs diverse initial access methods including supply chain compromise (SolarWinds), password spraying, spearphishing with ISO/IMG attachments, abuse of trusted relationships, and exploitation of internet-facing applications. Post-compromise, they use residential proxies, compromised cloud tenants, and legitimate services for C2. They abuse OAuth applications, Azure AD, and Microsoft 365 for persistent access. Custom tooling includes WellMess, WellMail, EnvyScout, NativeZone, and MagicWeb. The group demonstrates exceptional ability to live off the land in cloud environments."
