# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Black Basta is a prolific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that emerged in April 2022
    and is believed to have originated from former members of the Conti ransomware group following
    its dissolution. The group operates a double-extortion model, encrypting victim data and
    threatening to publish stolen information on their Tor-based leak site called "Basta News."
    Black Basta has compromised over 500 organizations globally across critical infrastructure
    sectors including healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, technology, and government.
    The group targets both Windows and Linux (including VMware ESXi) systems and is known for its
    rapid encryption speed and sophisticated initial access techniques including QakBot, Cobalt
    Strike, and social engineering via Microsoft Teams.
  why: >-
    Black Basta is one of the most active and damaging ransomware operations, with estimated
    ransom payments exceeding $100 million by late 2023. The group's connections to former Conti
    operators provide it with experienced personnel and established tooling. CISA and FBI issued
    joint advisory AA24-131A in May 2024 specifically addressing Black Basta. Their targeting of
    healthcare organizations, as demonstrated in the Ascension Health attack in May 2024, poses
    direct threats to patient safety. Internal chat leaks in February 2025 exposed the group's
    organizational structure, operational methods, and connections to Russian-speaking cybercriminal
    networks, providing significant intelligence for defenders.
  how: >-
    Black Basta employs diverse initial access vectors including phishing emails with QakBot or
    DarkGate malware, exploitation of known vulnerabilities (ConnectWise ScreenConnect CVE-2024-1709,
    Windows SmartScreen CVE-2024-21412), social engineering through Microsoft Teams impersonating
    IT support, and credential abuse. Post-compromise, the group deploys Cobalt Strike beacons for
    command and control, uses SystemBC for tunneling, and leverages tools including Mimikatz,
    SharpHound/BloodHound for Active Directory enumeration, and PsExec for lateral movement. The
    ransomware binary encrypts files using ChaCha20 with RSA-4096 key wrapping. The group disables
    security tools, deletes volume shadow copies, and modifies boot settings before encryption.
    Data exfiltration is performed using Rclone to attacker-controlled cloud storage prior to
    ransomware deployment.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Conti Successor"
      value: >-
        Black Basta is widely assessed as a successor or splinter group from the Conti ransomware
        operation, inheriting experienced operators, established infrastructure, and refined TTPs
        from one of the most prolific ransomware groups in history.
    - key: "RaaS Double Extortion"
      value: >-
        The group operates a ransomware-as-a-service model with double extortion, combining file
        encryption with data theft and the threat of public data exposure through their Basta News
        leak site.
