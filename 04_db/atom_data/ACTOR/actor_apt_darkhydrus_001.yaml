# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "DarkHydrus is a Middle Eastern APT group identified by Palo Alto Unit 42, targeting government entities, educational institutions, and critical infrastructure in the Middle East, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula region. Active since at least 2016, the group is known for using novel techniques such as DNS tunneling for command-and-control and Google Drive for C2 communications. They leverage credential harvesting, open-source tools, and custom malware including the RogueRobin trojan."
  why: "DarkHydrus is notable for its creative use of legitimate services and DNS-based techniques to evade detection. Their abuse of Google Drive API for command-and-control and reliance on DNS tunneling for data exfiltration demonstrates how APT groups can leverage trusted services to bypass network security controls. The group's targeting of Middle Eastern government entities suggests state-sponsored intelligence collection operations."
  how: "The group uses spearphishing emails with malicious Excel or Word documents containing macros that download and execute the RogueRobin trojan. RogueRobin communicates with operators through DNS tunneling, making C2 traffic appear as legitimate DNS queries. In later campaigns, the group evolved to use Google Drive API as an alternative C2 channel. They have also deployed open-source tools such as Phishery for credential harvesting and Meterpreter for post-exploitation. Persistence is achieved through scheduled tasks and registry modifications."
