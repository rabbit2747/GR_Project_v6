# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "ConfCrew, tracked by CERT-UA as UAC-0165, is a Russian-aligned threat group that has conducted destructive cyberattacks against Ukrainian critical infrastructure since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The group targets Ukrainian government agencies, telecommunications providers, energy companies, and internet service providers. ConfCrew is assessed to operate within or alongside the Sandworm (Seashell Blizzard) ecosystem, conducting disruptive operations using a combination of commodity tools and custom destructive malware."
  why: "ConfCrew is significant as a destructive operator targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure during active conflict. Their operations against telecommunications and energy sectors directly impact civilian populations and military communications. The group demonstrates how cyber operations are integrated into kinetic warfare, making their tactics relevant for understanding modern conflict-zone cyber threats."
  how: "The group exploits internet-facing services and uses compromised VPN credentials for initial access. They deploy Cobalt Strike, Impacket, and custom destructive tools to move laterally and prepare for destructive actions. Destructive operations have included wiper malware deployment, Active Directory compromise and mass credential reset, and destruction of network equipment configurations. The group also conducts data theft prior to destructive operations, following a hack-and-leak model."
