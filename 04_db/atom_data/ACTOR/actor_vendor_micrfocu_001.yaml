definition:
  what: "Micro Focus was a British software company acquired by OpenText in 2023, known in cybersecurity for its ArcSight SIEM platform, Fortify application security testing tools, and Voltage data protection solutions. ArcSight is one of the pioneering SIEM platforms used by enterprise security operations centers for log management, security event correlation, and compliance reporting. Fortify provides static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) for secure software development."
  why: "Micro Focus/OpenText is significant in cybersecurity because ArcSight remains a widely deployed enterprise SIEM platform that security operations teams depend on for threat detection, incident investigation, and compliance. Fortify is a key player in application security testing used in secure development lifecycles. Understanding these products is essential for security architects designing SOC infrastructure and DevSecOps pipelines."
  how: "ArcSight collects and normalizes log data from diverse sources through connectors, applies correlation rules to identify security events, provides dashboards and reporting for SOC analysts, and supports compliance frameworks through predefined content packages. Fortify integrates into CI/CD pipelines to perform static code analysis and dynamic application scanning. Voltage provides format-preserving encryption and data masking for sensitive data protection. These products are now maintained under the OpenText Cybersecurity portfolio."
