# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "ScarCruft, also tracked as APT37 or Reaper, is a North Korea-nexus advanced persistent threat group active since at least 2012. The group primarily targets South Korean government agencies, military organizations, media companies, defectors, and human rights organizations. ScarCruft has expanded its targeting to include Japan, Vietnam, Russia, and Middle Eastern entities. The group is assessed to operate under the North Korean Ministry of State Security (MSS)."
  why: "ScarCruft is one of North Korea's most active cyber-espionage groups, with operations supporting the regime's intelligence collection against perceived threats and dissidents. The group has demonstrated zero-day exploit capabilities and maintains an evolving malware arsenal, representing a persistent threat to South Korean national security and North Korean defector communities worldwide."
  how: "ScarCruft employs spear-phishing emails with malicious HWP (Hangul Word Processor) documents and Office files, watering hole attacks, and zero-day exploits (including Adobe Flash and Internet Explorer vulnerabilities). The group deploys custom malware including RokRAT, Bluelight, Goldbackdoor, and Chinotto, with capabilities spanning Windows, Android, and macOS platforms. C2 communications frequently abuse legitimate cloud services including Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive for data staging and exfiltration."
