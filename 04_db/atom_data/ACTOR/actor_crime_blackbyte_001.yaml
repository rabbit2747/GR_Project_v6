# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    BlackByte is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group that emerged in July 2021 and is known for
    exploiting software vulnerabilities for initial access rather than relying solely on phishing.
    The group has iteratively developed its ransomware through multiple versions written in C#, Go,
    and C/C++, demonstrating technical sophistication. BlackByte targets critical infrastructure
    including government, financial services, food and agriculture, and manufacturing sectors. The
    group employs a double-extortion model and is notable for its bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver
    (BYOVD) technique to disable endpoint security products by exploiting legitimate but vulnerable
    kernel drivers such as RTCore64.sys (MSI Afterburner) and other signed drivers.
  why: >-
    BlackByte was highlighted in a February 2022 joint CISA and FBI advisory (AA22-057A) for
    targeting US critical infrastructure, including a notable attack against the San Francisco 49ers
    NFL team. The group's sophisticated BYOVD technique (documented by Sophos as "Bring Your Own
    Driver") to disable EDR and security products represents a significant escalation in ransomware
    operator capabilities. BlackByte's continuous development of new ransomware variants across
    multiple programming languages demonstrates adaptive technical capability. Their exploitation
    of ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207) and ProxyLogon vulnerabilities
    for initial access differentiates them from phishing-dependent groups.
  how: >-
    BlackByte gains initial access primarily through exploitation of internet-facing vulnerabilities,
    particularly Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell and ProxyLogon vulnerabilities, and more recently
    through VMware ESXi vulnerabilities. Post-compromise, the group uses Cobalt Strike for command
    and control, AnyDesk for remote access, and deploys the ExByte custom exfiltration tool to steal
    data before encryption. The BYOVD technique leverages the RTCore64.sys driver (CVE-2019-16098)
    to gain kernel-level access and disable security products including EDR agents. The ransomware
    enumerates network shares, deletes volume shadow copies, disables Windows Firewall, and modifies
    registry settings before encrypting files. Recent variants have targeted VMware ESXi hypervisors
    to maximize impact across virtualized environments.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver)"
      value: >-
        BlackByte pioneered the widespread use of the BYOVD technique in ransomware operations,
        loading legitimate but vulnerable signed kernel drivers to gain kernel-level access and
        disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) security products.
    - key: "Multi-Language Ransomware Evolution"
      value: >-
        The group has rewritten their ransomware across C#, Go, and C/C++ languages, demonstrating
        continuous development effort and adaptability in their encryption tooling.
