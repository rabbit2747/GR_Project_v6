# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Red Mimicry is a suspected China-nexus advanced persistent threat group known for impersonating legitimate organizations and deploying custom backdoors in espionage campaigns. The group has targeted government entities, diplomatic organizations, and intergovernmental bodies, using infrastructure that mimics legitimate services to evade detection. The group overlaps with activity tracked by Recorded Future as TAG-100 and by Symantec as Scarab."
  why: "Red Mimicry is notable for its sophisticated operational security practices, particularly its use of infrastructure that closely mimics legitimate organizations and services. This deceptive approach makes detection challenging and demonstrates the group's emphasis on stealth and long-term persistence within targeted networks."
  how: "Red Mimicry establishes C2 infrastructure that impersonates legitimate organizations and services, registering domains that closely resemble authentic websites. The group uses spear-phishing with tailored lure documents for initial access, deploys custom backdoors such as Scieron and HeaderTip for persistent access, and leverages legitimate cloud services for data staging and exfiltration. The group demonstrates strong operational security by frequently rotating infrastructure and using encryption for communications."
