# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    BlackMatter is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that emerged in July 2021 as a
    direct successor to the DarkSide ransomware group, which was responsible for the Colonial
    Pipeline attack in May 2021. BlackMatter incorporated code and operational methods from both
    DarkSide and REvil ransomware families. The group operated a double-extortion model targeting
    critical infrastructure organizations including agriculture, food and beverage companies,
    and technology firms primarily in the United States, with notable attacks on NEW Cooperative
    and Olympus. BlackMatter announced its shutdown in November 2021 due to pressure from law
    enforcement, though its operators and affiliates are believed to have migrated to other
    ransomware operations including ALPHV/BlackCat.
  why: >-
    BlackMatter represents a critical case study in ransomware group rebranding and evolution.
    Its direct lineage from DarkSide, which triggered the Colonial Pipeline crisis and
    significant US government response, demonstrates how ransomware operators rebrand to evade
    law enforcement attention while maintaining operational continuity. CISA, FBI, and NSA
    issued joint advisory AA21-291A specifically addressing BlackMatter. The group's explicit
    prohibition against targeting hospitals, critical infrastructure like pipelines, and defense
    organizations was an attempt to avoid the intense government scrutiny that brought down
    DarkSide, though they still targeted agricultural cooperatives during harvest season.
    Emsisoft and law enforcement developed decryption capabilities that helped some victims
    recover without paying.
  how: >-
    BlackMatter gained initial access through compromised credentials purchased from initial
    access brokers, exploitation of VPN and remote access infrastructure, and phishing campaigns.
    The ransomware was available in Windows and Linux (ESXi) variants, encrypting files using
    a Salsa20 stream cipher with RSA-1024 key exchange. Post-compromise TTPs included credential
    harvesting using LSASS memory dumping, Active Directory enumeration via nltest and ADFind,
    lateral movement through SMB and PsExec, and data exfiltration using the ExMatter custom
    tool before encryption. The group operated a Tor-based leak site and negotiation portal.
    BlackMatter affiliates disabled security tools, deleted volume shadow copies, and targeted
    VMware ESXi hypervisors to encrypt virtual machine disk files for maximum operational impact.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "DarkSide Lineage"
      value: >-
        BlackMatter is a direct rebranding of the DarkSide RaaS operation that conducted the
        Colonial Pipeline attack, incorporating DarkSide code, infrastructure, and operational
        personnel while attempting to distance itself from the intense law enforcement scrutiny.
    - key: "RaaS Ecosystem Migration"
      value: >-
        When BlackMatter shut down in November 2021, its operators and affiliates migrated to
        ALPHV/BlackCat and other RaaS operations, demonstrating the fluid nature of the
        ransomware criminal ecosystem.
