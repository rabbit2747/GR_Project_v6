# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "SolarWinds is an IT infrastructure management vendor providing network monitoring, systems management, database performance, and security information and event management solutions. The company is widely deployed across enterprise and government environments through products including Orion network performance monitor, Server and Application Monitor, and Security Event Manager. SolarWinds became a household name in cybersecurity after the 2020 supply chain attack that compromised its Orion software build system."
  why: "SolarWinds is critically significant in cybersecurity both as a major IT monitoring vendor and as the subject of one of the most impactful supply chain attacks in history. The SUNBURST attack of 2020, attributed to Russian intelligence, compromised SolarWinds' Orion build process to distribute backdoored software updates to approximately 18,000 organizations including US government agencies, fundamentally changing how the industry views software supply chain security."
  how: "SolarWinds operates through a portfolio of IT management products that use agent-based and agentless monitoring to collect telemetry from network devices, servers, applications, and databases. The Orion platform provides centralized dashboards for network performance monitoring, configuration management, and log analysis. Following the 2020 breach, SolarWinds implemented a Secure by Design initiative including reproducible builds and enhanced development security."
