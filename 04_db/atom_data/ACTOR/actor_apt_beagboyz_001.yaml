# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Beagle Boyz is a North Korean state-sponsored threat subgroup, a component of the broader HIDDEN COBRA (Lazarus Group) umbrella, focused on financially motivated cyber operations targeting banks and financial institutions worldwide. Identified by CISA and the U.S. Cyber Command in 2020, the group has conducted fraudulent ATM cash-out operations (FASTCash), SWIFT interbank messaging manipulation, and cryptocurrency theft across more than 30 countries since at least 2015."
  why: "Beagle Boyz is critical to understanding North Korean revenue generation through cybercrime. Their operations have resulted in attempted thefts of nearly two billion dollars from financial institutions. The group represents the intersection of state-sponsored APT capabilities with financially motivated crime, as stolen funds are believed to support North Korean weapons programs and regime funding."
  how: "The group gains initial access through spearphishing, watering hole attacks, and social engineering. They conduct extensive lateral movement within banking networks to reach SWIFT terminals and ATM switch servers. FASTCash operations involve deploying malicious scripts on payment switch application servers to intercept and manipulate ATM transaction messages. The group also manipulates SWIFT messages to initiate fraudulent transfers and has expanded into cryptocurrency exchange targeting and theft."
