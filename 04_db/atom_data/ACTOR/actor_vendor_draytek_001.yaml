definition:
  what: "DrayTek is a Taiwanese networking equipment manufacturer specializing in routers, firewalls, VPN concentrators, switches, and wireless access points primarily for small-to-medium business (SMB) and enterprise branch office deployments. The Vigor product line includes multi-WAN routers with integrated firewall, VPN, and content filtering capabilities. DrayTek devices are widely deployed in Europe and Asia-Pacific markets."
  why: "DrayTek is significant in cybersecurity because its networking equipment serves as critical perimeter infrastructure for thousands of organizations. Vulnerabilities in DrayTek Vigor routers and firewalls have been actively exploited by threat actors for initial access, including remote code execution flaws and zero-day exploits targeting the web management interface. DrayTek devices have been targets in multiple botnet campaigns and APT operations due to their internet-facing deployment."
  how: "DrayTek provides network security through integrated firewall, VPN (IPsec, SSL VPN, WireGuard), content filtering, and access control features in its Vigor router product line. The devices offer centralized management through VigorACS, web-based administration, and SNMP monitoring. DrayTek publishes firmware updates to address security vulnerabilities and provides security advisories through their support portal."
