# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Luminous Moth is a Chinese-linked APT group identified by Kaspersky in 2021 that conducted a large-scale cyber espionage campaign targeting government entities in Southeast Asia, particularly in Myanmar and the Philippines. The group is notable for an unusually high volume of infections, with approximately 100 victims in Myanmar and 1,400 in the Philippines, suggesting a broad-sweep approach rather than targeted precision."
  why: "The campaign aligns with Chinese intelligence collection interests in Southeast Asian political affairs, particularly regarding Myanmar's political situation and Philippine government activities related to South China Sea disputes. The unusually large number of infections suggests the group prioritized breadth of collection over operational security, potentially indicating time-sensitive intelligence requirements."
  how: "Luminous Moth uses spear-phishing emails with malicious DLL side-loading payloads as the initial infection vector. A distinctive technique involves USB propagation where the malware spreads to removable drives by creating hidden copies of files and replacing them with malicious executables disguised with the original file icons. The group deploys a Cobalt Strike beacon for post-exploitation, uses Chrome cookie stealers, and has been observed deploying a fake Zoom application that exfiltrates files. Connections to the HoneyMyte/Mustang Panda group have been identified through shared infrastructure."
