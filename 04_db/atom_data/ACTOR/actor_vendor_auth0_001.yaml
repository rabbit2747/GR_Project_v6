# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Auth0 is an identity and access management platform founded in 2013, acquired by Okta in 2021. Auth0 provides authentication and authorization as a service, offering universal login, multi-factor authentication, single sign-on, social login integration, and adaptive access control. The platform is developer-focused, providing SDKs and APIs for embedding identity management into web, mobile, and IoT applications without building authentication systems from scratch."
  why: "Auth0 is significant because authentication and authorization are foundational security controls, and misconfiguration of these systems is a leading cause of data breaches. Auth0 reduces the risk of authentication vulnerabilities by providing a well-tested, standards-compliant identity platform that developers can integrate with minimal security expertise. As an Okta subsidiary, Auth0 serves as critical identity infrastructure for thousands of applications."
  how: "Auth0 provides identity services through a cloud-hosted platform that supports OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML, and WS-Federation protocols. Developers integrate Auth0 using SDKs for various languages and frameworks. The platform handles user registration, credential storage, MFA enrollment, social login federation, and adaptive risk-based authentication. Auth0 Actions allow custom logic to be executed during authentication flows."
