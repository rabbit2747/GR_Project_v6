# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Red Penguin, most widely known as APT28 or Fancy Bear, is a Russia-nexus advanced persistent threat group attributed to the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Unit 26165. Active since at least 2004, it is one of the most prolific and sophisticated state-sponsored threat actors globally, targeting government agencies, military organizations, defense contractors, media outlets, political organizations, and critical infrastructure across NATO member states and former Soviet countries."
  why: "Red Penguin/APT28 represents one of the most significant cyber threats from a nation-state actor due to its attribution to Russian military intelligence and its role in high-profile operations including interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Democratic National Committee breach, and destructive attacks against international organizations. The group's operations directly support Russian strategic military and geopolitical objectives."
  how: "Red Penguin employs a diverse arsenal including zero-day exploits, credential phishing via OAuth abuse and fake login pages, watering hole attacks, and exploitation of public-facing applications. Key malware families include X-Agent/Sofacy, XTunnel, Zebrocy, and GoDownloader. The group uses compromised email accounts for lateral phishing, deploys VPN exploitation capabilities, and leverages legitimate services for C2 communications. It also conducts hack-and-leak operations for information warfare."
