definition:
  what: >-
    CyberMerchants is a cybercriminal marketplace and access broker operation that facilitates the
    trade of stolen credentials, compromised access, and cybercrime-as-a-service offerings on dark
    web forums and encrypted messaging platforms. The group operates as intermediaries in the
    cybercriminal supply chain, connecting initial access brokers who compromise organizations with
    ransomware operators and other threat actors who monetize that access. CyberMerchants trades in
    corporate VPN credentials, RDP access, web shell access to compromised servers, stolen databases,
    and custom malware tools. The operation functions as a marketplace aggregator, vetting sellers
    and providing escrow services to facilitate trust between criminal parties.
  why: >-
    CyberMerchants represents the growing professionalization and specialization of the cybercriminal
    supply chain, where dedicated marketplace operators enable the efficient connection of disparate
    criminal actors. Access brokers who sell through marketplaces like CyberMerchants directly enable
    ransomware operations by providing the initial foothold that ransomware affiliates require. The
    commoditization of corporate access through these marketplaces has lowered the barrier to entry
    for ransomware attacks, as affiliates no longer need to conduct their own initial compromise.
    Understanding access broker marketplaces is essential for threat intelligence analysts tracking
    the pre-attack supply chain and for organizations attempting to identify whether their
    credentials or access are being traded in criminal markets.
  how: >-
    CyberMerchants operates primarily through Tor-based dark web marketplaces and encrypted
    communication channels on Telegram and XMPP. The operation curates listings from initial
    access brokers who have compromised organizations through credential stuffing, phishing,
    vulnerability exploitation, or insider access. Listings typically include the type of access
    (VPN, RDP, web shell, admin panel), the victim's industry and country, estimated revenue of
    the victim organization, and the level of access obtained. Pricing varies from $500 to $50,000+
    depending on the target's size and access level. The marketplace implements reputation systems,
    escrow services, and dispute resolution to build trust among criminal participants. CyberMerchants
    also brokers bulk credential dumps, exploit code, and malware-as-a-service offerings.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Cybercriminal Supply Chain"
      value: >-
        CyberMerchants exemplifies the specialized supply chain in cybercrime where dedicated
        marketplace operators connect access brokers with ransomware affiliates and other threat
        actors, enabling efficient criminal commerce and lowering barriers to entry.
    - key: "Access Brokerage"
      value: >-
        The primary business model involves brokering corporate access obtained through various
        compromise methods, with listings categorized by access type, industry, geography, and
        victim organization size to enable efficient matching with buyers.
