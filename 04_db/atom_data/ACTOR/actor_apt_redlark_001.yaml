definition:
  what: "Red Lark, widely tracked as APT15 or Ke3chang, is a China-nexus advanced persistent threat group active since at least 2010. The group conducts long-running cyber-espionage campaigns primarily targeting ministries of foreign affairs, government entities, diplomatic missions, and international organizations in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. The group is assessed to operate in support of Chinese foreign intelligence collection."
  why: "Red Lark is significant due to its sustained multi-year targeting of diplomatic and governmental institutions across numerous countries. The group's focus on foreign affairs ministries and international organizations indicates a mandate for collecting strategic diplomatic intelligence and supporting Chinese foreign policy objectives."
  how: "Red Lark employs spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. The group utilizes custom malware families including Ketrican, Okrum, BS2005, Ketrum, and RoyalCli. It establishes persistence through scheduled tasks and registry modifications, moves laterally using legitimate administrative tools, and exfiltrates data via encrypted channels. The group has also exploited vulnerable internet-facing web servers and used VPN infrastructure for operations."
