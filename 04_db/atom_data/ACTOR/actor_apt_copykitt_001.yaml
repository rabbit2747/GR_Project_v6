# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "CopyKittens is an Iranian APT group active since at least 2013, targeting government agencies, defense organizations, academic institutions, and IT companies primarily in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Germany, and the United States. The group is characterized by its use of publicly available offensive tools and custom malware, notably the Matryoshka RAT, rather than sophisticated zero-day exploits. Despite their relatively lower technical sophistication, the group has maintained persistent and effective espionage operations."
  why: "CopyKittens demonstrates that effective cyber-espionage does not require advanced technical capabilities. The group's ability to compromise targets using mostly public tools and basic custom malware highlights the threat from persistent, motivated actors who leverage strategic web compromise and social engineering. Their targeting of Israeli defense and government entities aligns with Iranian intelligence collection priorities."
  how: "The group relies on strategic web compromises (watering holes), spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, and fake social media profiles for initial access. They deploy the Matryoshka RAT framework, which provides multi-stage backdoor access with modular capabilities. The group also uses publicly available tools including Metasploit, Mimikatz, and Empire for post-exploitation. Web shells on compromised servers provide persistent access, and data exfiltration occurs over HTTP/HTTPS channels to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
