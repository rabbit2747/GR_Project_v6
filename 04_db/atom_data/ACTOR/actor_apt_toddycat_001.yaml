# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "ToddyCat is a sophisticated advanced persistent threat group discovered by Kaspersky Lab, active since at least December 2020. The group conducts cyber-espionage campaigns targeting government organizations and military entities primarily in the Asia-Pacific region, including countries such as Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan. ToddyCat initially exploited the Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon vulnerability chain for initial access and demonstrated advanced persistent access capabilities."
  why: "ToddyCat is significant for its targeting of high-value government and military organizations across multiple Asia-Pacific nations, suggesting a broad intelligence collection mandate. The group's early adoption of the ProxyLogon vulnerability before widespread awareness and its sophisticated custom tooling demonstrate high technical capability. The group's persistent operations indicate sustained interest in strategic intelligence from the region."
  how: "ToddyCat initially exploited ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-26855) vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers for initial access. The group deploys a custom passive backdoor called Samurai and a modular trojan called Ninja for persistent access and lateral movement. These tools support extensive post-exploitation capabilities including file collection, process manipulation, network tunneling, and data exfiltration. The group also uses commodity tools like loaders for Cobalt Strike and custom data collection utilities targeting specific file types and email databases."
