# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "RedHunt Labs is a cybersecurity company specializing in attack surface management, external threat intelligence, and offensive security research. The company provides automated attack surface discovery and monitoring solutions that help organizations identify exposed assets, misconfigurations, and potential attack vectors visible from the internet. RedHunt Labs also contributes open-source security tools and publishes threat research."
  why: "RedHunt Labs is relevant to cybersecurity because attack surface management has become a critical discipline as organizations increasingly expose digital assets through cloud adoption, remote work, and digital transformation. Their tools and research help organizations understand their external attack surface, identifying shadow IT, exposed services, and exploitable misconfigurations before attackers discover them."
  how: "RedHunt Labs provides automated continuous discovery and monitoring of an organization's internet-facing assets including domains, subdomains, IP addresses, open ports, exposed services, and cloud resources. The platform identifies misconfigurations, exposed credentials, data leaks, and vulnerable services through passive and active reconnaissance techniques. The company publishes security research and contributes open-source tools for attack surface enumeration and threat hunting."
