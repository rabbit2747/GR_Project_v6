# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "OilRig (also known as APT34, Hazel Sandstorm, and Helix Kitten) is an Iranian state-sponsored cyber espionage group attributed to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Active since at least 2014, the group primarily targets organizations in the Middle East including government agencies, financial institutions, telecommunications, energy, and chemical sectors, with a particular focus on Gulf state nations and Israel."
  why: "OilRig conducts intelligence collection operations supporting Iranian state interests in the Middle East, focusing on political intelligence from regional adversaries, economic and trade intelligence particularly regarding energy sector competitors, financial intelligence for sanctions evasion support, and technological intelligence from critical infrastructure operators."
  how: "OilRig is known for extensive credential harvesting through fake login pages mimicking legitimate services, spear-phishing with weaponized documents, and exploitation of public-facing web applications. The group deploys numerous custom malware families including POWBAT, BONDUPDATER, Shark, Milan, Marlin, and SideTwist. A signature technique is DNS tunneling for C2 and data exfiltration, implemented through various custom tools. The group also uses web shells extensively and has developed sophisticated supply chain compromise capabilities. Internal tools were leaked in 2019 by a group calling themselves Lab Dookhtegan."
