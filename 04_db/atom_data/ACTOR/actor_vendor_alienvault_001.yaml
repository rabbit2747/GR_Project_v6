# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "AlienVault is a cybersecurity company founded in 2007, best known for its Unified Security Management (USM) platform and the Open Threat Exchange (OTX), one of the world's largest open threat intelligence communities. Acquired by AT&T in 2018, AlienVault's USM platform combines SIEM, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and behavioral monitoring into a single solution. OTX provides a collaborative platform where security researchers share indicators of compromise and threat intelligence freely."
  why: "AlienVault is significant for democratizing threat intelligence through OTX, which enables organizations of all sizes to access community-contributed indicators of compromise and threat data. Their USM platform made enterprise-grade security monitoring accessible to mid-market organizations that could not afford separate SIEM, IDS, and vulnerability management tools."
  how: "AlienVault operates through its USM platform that integrates asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, and SIEM into a unified console. The OTX platform aggregates threat intelligence from a global community of over 200,000 security professionals, distributing pulses containing IOCs, TTPs, and contextual threat data via API integration."
