definition:
  what: "Safety Detectives is a cybersecurity review and research website that publishes security product reviews, comparisons, and cybersecurity research. The site is known for its research team that discovers and responsibly discloses data exposures, misconfigured databases, and open data leaks on the internet. Safety Detectives has reported numerous significant data exposures involving unsecured Elasticsearch instances, MongoDB databases, and cloud storage buckets containing sensitive personal and business information."
  why: "Safety Detectives is relevant to cybersecurity because their research team actively scans for and responsibly discloses exposed databases and data leaks, helping organizations discover and remediate inadvertent data exposures before they are exploited by malicious actors. Their data exposure reports highlight the persistent problem of misconfigured cloud storage and databases, raising awareness about basic security hygiene in cloud environments."
  how: "Safety Detectives' research team uses internet scanning tools and techniques to identify publicly accessible databases, cloud storage buckets, and misconfigured services that expose sensitive data. When exposures are discovered, the team attempts to identify the data owner, notifies them through responsible disclosure, and publishes sanitized reports describing the scope and nature of the exposure. The website also provides consumer-oriented cybersecurity product reviews and guides."
