# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "ReversingLabs is a cybersecurity company specializing in file and software supply chain security through advanced static binary analysis and threat intelligence. The platform analyzes billions of files using proprietary decomposition technology to identify malware, software tampering, supply chain threats, and hidden threats in complex file formats without execution. ReversingLabs maintains one of the world's largest malware repositories and goodware databases for classification and threat intelligence."
  why: "ReversingLabs is significant in cybersecurity because their static analysis approach can detect threats that evade sandbox-based dynamic analysis, including dormant malware, supply chain tampering, and obfuscated threats embedded in complex file formats. Their technology is increasingly critical as software supply chain attacks grow in frequency and sophistication, providing visibility into the integrity of software packages, containers, and release artifacts."
  how: "ReversingLabs performs deep static analysis through proprietary file decomposition that extracts and analyzes embedded objects, scripts, macros, and binary components within complex file formats without executing them. The platform classifies files against a massive database of known malware signatures, goodware fingerprints, and behavioral indicators. Their supply chain security products integrate into CI/CD pipelines to scan software releases, container images, and third-party packages for tampering, malware, and policy violations."
