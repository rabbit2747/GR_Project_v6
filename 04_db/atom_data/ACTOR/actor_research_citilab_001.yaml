definition:
  what: "The Citizen Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto, founded by Ronald Deibert in 2001. It focuses on research at the intersection of information and communication technologies, human rights, and global security. The Citizen Lab is internationally recognized for its groundbreaking investigations into digital espionage, commercial spyware such as NSO Group's Pegasus, internet censorship and surveillance, and targeted threats against civil society, journalists, and human rights defenders."
  why: "The Citizen Lab is critically important to cybersecurity because it uncovers state-sponsored surveillance operations and commercial spyware deployments that threaten human rights, press freedom, and civil liberties worldwide. Its research has led to major public policy debates, legal actions against spyware vendors, and improved security practices for at-risk populations including journalists, activists, and political dissidents."
  how: "The Citizen Lab employs a combination of technical analysis, including network scanning, reverse engineering of spyware, forensic analysis of targeted devices, and internet measurement, together with policy research and legal analysis. Researchers analyze malware samples, map command-and-control infrastructure, and correlate technical indicators with geopolitical context to attribute surveillance operations and publish detailed public reports."
