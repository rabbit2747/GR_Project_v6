# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Carbon Black is a cybersecurity company that pioneered endpoint detection and response (EDR) technology, originally founded in 2002 as Bit9. Acquired by VMware in 2019 and subsequently part of Broadcom, Carbon Black provides cloud-native endpoint protection, workload security, and threat hunting capabilities. The Carbon Black Cloud platform delivers next-generation antivirus, EDR, managed detection, and vulnerability management through a single lightweight agent and cloud-based console."
  why: "Carbon Black is historically significant as one of the companies that defined the EDR category, shifting the endpoint security paradigm from prevention-only to detection and response. Their approach of continuously recording endpoint activity for retrospective threat hunting and forensic analysis fundamentally changed how organizations detect and investigate advanced threats. The technology continues as a core component of VMware/Broadcom's security portfolio."
  how: "Carbon Black operates through its cloud platform using a lightweight sensor agent that continuously records endpoint activity including process executions, file modifications, registry changes, and network connections. This telemetry enables real-time threat detection through behavioral analysis, retrospective threat hunting across historical data, and automated response actions. The platform integrates with SIEM, SOAR, and vulnerability management tools."
