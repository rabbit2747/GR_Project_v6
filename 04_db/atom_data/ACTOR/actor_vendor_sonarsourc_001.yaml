# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "SonarSource is a code quality and security analysis vendor providing static application security testing (SAST) tools through its SonarQube, SonarCloud, and SonarLint products. The company's platforms analyze source code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities across over 30 programming languages, enabling development teams to maintain code quality and identify security issues early in the software development lifecycle."
  why: "SonarSource is significant in cybersecurity because static code analysis is a critical component of secure software development, enabling the detection of security vulnerabilities before code reaches production. SonarQube has become one of the most widely adopted code quality platforms in the industry, integrated into CI/CD pipelines across thousands of organizations to enforce code quality gates and security standards."
  how: "SonarSource operates through static analysis engines that parse source code, build abstract syntax trees, and apply hundreds of security and quality rules to detect issues. SonarQube provides self-hosted analysis, SonarCloud offers cloud-based scanning integrated with code repositories, and SonarLint provides real-time IDE feedback. The platform integrates with CI/CD pipelines to enforce quality gates that prevent vulnerable code from being merged or deployed."
