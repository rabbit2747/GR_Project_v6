# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Pointer Authentication Project Zero refers to the security research conducted by Google Project Zero into ARM Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC), a hardware-based exploit mitigation feature in ARM processors used in Apple devices and other ARM-based platforms. The research examined the security guarantees and limitations of pointer authentication, identified bypass techniques, and analyzed how PAC implementations can be circumvented through various attack vectors including speculative execution, signing gadgets, and implementation weaknesses. This research is critical to understanding the security of modern ARM-based devices including iPhones, iPads, and Apple Silicon Macs."
  why: "This research is significant because pointer authentication is a fundamental hardware-level security mitigation against memory corruption exploits on ARM platforms, particularly Apple's A-series and M-series chips. Understanding PAC bypasses is essential for evaluating the real-world security of billions of devices and for developing more robust exploit mitigations. The findings inform both offensive exploit development and defensive security engineering for ARM platforms."
  how: "Project Zero researchers analyzed the ARM PAC specification and its implementations, developed proof-of-concept bypass techniques, studied the interaction between PAC and other exploit mitigations, and documented the conditions under which pointer authentication can be defeated. The research involved reverse engineering of PAC implementations, analysis of signing and verification gadgets, and evaluation of PAC's effectiveness against various classes of memory corruption vulnerabilities."
