# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "BlueNoroff is a North Korean state-sponsored APT subgroup within the Lazarus Group umbrella, focused primarily on financially motivated cyber operations targeting banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, venture capital firms, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Active since at least 2014, the group was responsible for the 2016 Bangladesh Bank heist via SWIFT network compromise and has since evolved to heavily target the cryptocurrency ecosystem, stealing billions of dollars to fund the DPRK regime."
  why: "BlueNoroff represents one of the most financially damaging APT operations globally, having stolen over three billion dollars in cryptocurrency and traditional financial assets. The group is a primary revenue generator for the North Korean regime and its weapons programs. Their evolution from traditional banking attacks to cryptocurrency and DeFi targeting demonstrates sophisticated adaptation to new financial technologies and their security gaps."
  how: "The group uses highly targeted social engineering, often impersonating venture capitalists, recruiters, or cryptocurrency investors to lure targets. They deploy macOS malware (RustBucket, ObjCShellz) and Windows backdoors through trojanized cryptocurrency applications and malicious documents. For cryptocurrency theft, they compromise hot wallets, exploit smart contract vulnerabilities, and conduct supply chain attacks against cryptocurrency software. The group uses extensive infrastructure for money laundering through mixers, chain-hopping, and peer-to-peer exchanges."
