# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "ReaQta is a cybersecurity company that developed an AI-powered endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform using autonomous behavioral analysis and nano-OS hypervisor technology. The platform was designed to detect threats without relying on signatures by monitoring endpoint behavior at the hypervisor level. ReaQta was acquired by IBM in 2022 and integrated into the IBM Security QRadar EDR product line, extending IBM's extended detection and response capabilities."
  why: "ReaQta is significant in cybersecurity for its innovative approach to endpoint security using hypervisor-based monitoring that operates below the operating system level, making it resistant to evasion techniques that target OS-level security tools. The acquisition by IBM validated the approach and brought the technology into IBM's broader security portfolio, influencing the direction of enterprise EDR solutions."
  how: "ReaQta's platform deployed a nano-OS hypervisor on endpoints that monitored system behavior from below the operating system, capturing process execution, file operations, network connections, and memory activity. AI models analyzed behavioral patterns to identify anomalous activity indicative of malware, lateral movement, or data exfiltration without relying on signatures. The technology now operates as IBM Security QRadar EDR, integrated with QRadar SIEM and SOAR for unified security operations."
