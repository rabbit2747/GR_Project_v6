# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "CaddyWiper is a destructive wiper malware discovered in March 2022 targeting Ukrainian organizations during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It destroys data on Windows systems by overwriting user files and disk partitions, with specific focus on Active Directory domain environments. The malware operates selectively, avoiding system-critical files to maintain temporary operability while destroying user data."
  why: "CaddyWiper serves as a cyber weapon deployed to disrupt Ukrainian organizations, causing data loss and operational chaos. Its selective destruction pattern suggests sophisticated targeting to maximize organizational impact while delaying detection by keeping systems partially functional."
  how: "CaddyWiper typically deploys through compromised networks with domain administrator privileges. It enumerates attached storage devices and systematically overwrites user data and partition information with null bytes. The wiper checks for domain membership before executing, suggesting targeted deployment against specific networks. It destroys data partition-by-partition, including external drives and network shares, while avoiding critical system files that would cause immediate system failure. This approach maximizes data loss while maintaining temporary system function."
