# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "AcidPour is a destructive wiper malware variant based on AcidRain that targets Linux-based systems, network devices, and IoT equipment. Discovered in 2024, it destroys data by overwriting storage devices and corrupting filesystems, rendering systems inoperable. It represents an evolution of the AcidRain wiper with expanded targeting capabilities."
  why: "Attackers deploy AcidPour as a destructive cyberweapon in targeted attacks to cause operational disruption, destroy evidence, or as part of broader cyber warfare operations against critical infrastructure and network equipment."
  how: "AcidPour executes with elevated privileges and systematically overwrites storage devices, including hard drives, SSDs, and other block devices. It corrupts filesystem structures, deletes critical system files, and targets specific network and IoT device configurations. The wiper operates by directly writing to device files and using system calls to maximize destruction. Unlike ransomware, AcidPour provides no recovery mechanism and aims for permanent data loss."

  embedding_text: "AcidPour is destructive wiper malware targeting Linux systems, network devices, and IoT equipment. Discovered in 2024 as an evolution of AcidRain, it permanently destroys data by systematically overwriting storage devices and corrupting filesystems. Operating with elevated privileges, AcidPour directly writes to device files to maximize destruction, targeting hard drives, SSDs, and embedded storage. It corrupts filesystem structures and deletes critical system files, rendering systems inoperable. Unlike ransomware, AcidPour provides no recovery mechanism and aims for permanent data loss. Deployed as a cyber weapon in targeted attacks, it causes operational disruption against critical infrastructure and network equipment, representing the ongoing evolution of destructive malware threats."
