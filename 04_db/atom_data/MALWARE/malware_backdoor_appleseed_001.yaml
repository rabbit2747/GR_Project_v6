# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "AppleSeed is a sophisticated Windows backdoor malware attributed to the Kimsuky APT group (Lazarus subgroup). It provides comprehensive remote access capabilities including file operations, command execution, keylogging, and data exfiltration through encrypted command-and-control channels."
  why: "Deployed in targeted cyber espionage campaigns primarily against government, defense, and diplomatic entities. Enables long-term intelligence gathering, document theft, and persistent monitoring of high-value targets for strategic information collection."
  how: "Initially delivered through spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, establishes persistence via registry run keys and scheduled tasks, communicates with C2 servers using HTTP/HTTPS with custom encryption, implements anti-analysis techniques, and performs systematic data harvesting focusing on sensitive documents and credentials."

  embedding_text: "AppleSeed is a Windows backdoor malware used by the Kimsuky APT group for cyber espionage operations. Primarily targeting government, defense, and diplomatic organizations, it provides comprehensive remote access including file operations, command execution, keylogging, and systematic data exfiltration. The malware is typically delivered through spear-phishing campaigns with malicious email attachments. AppleSeed establishes persistence through registry modifications and scheduled tasks while maintaining encrypted C2 communications via HTTP/HTTPS protocols. It implements anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and focuses on harvesting sensitive documents, credentials, and strategic intelligence. The backdoor supports modular functionality allowing operators to adapt capabilities for specific targeting requirements in long-term espionage campaigns."
