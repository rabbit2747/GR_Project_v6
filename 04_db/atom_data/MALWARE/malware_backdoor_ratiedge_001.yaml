# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Rational Edge is a modular backdoor designed for Windows environments, providing remote access, system enumeration, and data collection capabilities. The malware uses sophisticated anti-analysis techniques and encrypted communications to maintain persistent access while evading detection by security software."
  why: "Threat actors deploy Rational Edge to establish long-term access to targeted networks for espionage and data theft. Its modular architecture allows operators to customize functionality based on mission objectives while minimizing footprint and detection risk through selective module deployment."
  how: "The backdoor installs as a Windows service or through registry persistence mechanisms, establishes encrypted C2 channels using custom protocols, downloads and executes additional modules based on tasking requirements, performs system and network reconnaissance, collects credentials and sensitive files, and exfiltrates data through encrypted channels. Anti-analysis features include VM detection, debugger checks, and code obfuscation."

  embedding_text: "Rational Edge is a modular Windows backdoor designed for long-term espionage and data collection. It establishes persistence through Windows services or registry modifications, communicates via encrypted custom protocols, and downloads modules based on operational requirements. The malware performs system reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and data exfiltration while employing anti-analysis techniques including VM detection and debugger checks. Its modular architecture allows selective deployment of capabilities to minimize detection risk. Rational Edge represents advanced persistent threat tooling focused on stealth and operational flexibility. Detection requires behavioral analysis, service monitoring, network traffic inspection for custom protocols, and memory forensics to identify loaded modules."
