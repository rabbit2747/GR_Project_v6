# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "BlackEnergy is a sophisticated modular malware platform primarily known for targeting industrial control systems and critical infrastructure. Originally developed as a DDoS botnet tool, it evolved through multiple versions (BlackEnergy2, BlackEnergy3) into a multi-purpose cyber weapon used in advanced persistent threat campaigns. The malware gained international notoriety for its role in the 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack, which caused widespread blackouts. BlackEnergy features a plugin-based architecture enabling diverse capabilities including remote control, data destruction, information theft, and industrial system disruption."
  why: "BlackEnergy serves as a strategic cyber weapon for nation-state actors targeting critical infrastructure, particularly energy sector and industrial control systems. Its modular design allows operators to customize capabilities for specific industrial environments, from reconnaissance and data collection to destructive attacks on operational technology systems. The malware's ability to bridge IT and OT networks makes it particularly dangerous for disrupting essential services and causing physical damage."
  how: "BlackEnergy typically spreads through spearphishing campaigns with malicious Office documents containing macro-based droppers or exploiting vulnerabilities in exposed systems. Upon execution, it establishes persistence through service installation and registry modifications. The malware downloads plugins from command-and-control servers enabling specific functions including KillDisk for data destruction, credential harvesting modules, network propagation tools, and specialized components for targeting SCADA and HMI systems. BlackEnergy can enumerate industrial protocols, manipulate control logic, and execute destructive payloads on operational technology networks."

  embedding_text: "BlackEnergy is a modular malware platform evolved from DDoS tool into sophisticated cyber weapon targeting critical infrastructure and industrial control systems. Famous for 2015 Ukraine power grid attack causing blackouts, it bridges IT and OT networks to disrupt operational technology. Features plugin-based architecture with capabilities for ICS reconnaissance, SCADA manipulation, data destruction via KillDisk component, and remote control. Spreads through spearphishing with malicious macros, establishes persistence through services, downloads specialized plugins for industrial protocols. Associated with nation-state threat actors, particularly Sandworm group. Targets Windows and Linux systems in energy sector and critical infrastructure environments."
