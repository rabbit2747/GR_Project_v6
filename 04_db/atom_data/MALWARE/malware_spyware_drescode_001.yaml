# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "DressCode is Android malware discovered in thousands of applications that turns infected devices into SOCKS proxies for attackers, enabling them to route malicious traffic through victim networks, exfiltrate corporate data, and bypass network security controls by leveraging compromised mobile devices as network pivoting points."
  why: "Cybercriminals deploy DressCode to establish covert network tunnels through infected Android devices, enabling lateral movement into corporate networks, bypassing firewalls and security appliances, conducting man-in-the-middle attacks, and utilizing victim bandwidth for various malicious activities including spam distribution and click fraud while remaining undetected."
  how: "DressCode infiltrates devices through trojanized applications distributed via third-party app stores and occasionally through compromised legitimate apps. Once installed, it establishes a SOCKS proxy server on the infected device, connects to attacker C2 infrastructure, and allows remote attackers to route arbitrary network traffic through the compromised device, effectively using it as a network gateway into trusted environments."

  embedding_text: "DressCode represents a significant evolution in mobile malware by transforming infected Android devices into network proxies for attackers. The malware was discovered embedded in over 3,000 applications with millions of installations across both third-party stores and briefly on Google Play. DressCode establishes SOCKS proxy servers on compromised devices, allowing attackers to route malicious traffic through victim networks. This technique is particularly dangerous in corporate environments where employees connect personal devices to enterprise networks, as it provides attackers with a foothold inside the corporate perimeter, bypassing firewalls and security appliances. The malware enables various attacks including corporate data exfiltration, lateral movement within networks, man-in-the-middle attacks against internal services, and abuse of corporate resources. DressCode highlights the risks of BYOD policies and the challenges of securing network perimeters when mobile devices can be weaponized as network access points by sophisticated adversaries."
