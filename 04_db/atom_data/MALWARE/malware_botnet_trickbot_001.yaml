# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "TrickBot is a sophisticated modular banking trojan and botnet infrastructure that evolved from Dyre malware. Initially focused on credential theft from banking applications, it expanded to become a multi-purpose malware platform with capabilities including reconnaissance, lateral movement, payload delivery, and ransomware deployment. TrickBot features a plugin-based architecture enabling dynamic functionality updates, credential harvesting modules, network propagation tools, and integration with other malware families including Ryuk and Conti ransomware."
  why: "TrickBot serves as a versatile initial access and post-exploitation platform for cybercriminal operations. Its modular design allows threat actors to customize capabilities for specific targets, from financial fraud to corporate espionage and ransomware campaigns. The malware's ability to harvest credentials, map networks, and facilitate lateral movement makes it valuable for establishing persistent footholds in enterprise environments."
  how: "TrickBot typically spreads through malicious email attachments, compromised websites, or via other malware like Emotet. Upon execution, it establishes persistence through scheduled tasks and registry modifications. The malware contacts command-and-control servers to download additional modules including credential stealers (pwgrab, injectDll), network reconnaissance tools (networkDll, shareDll), propagation modules (wormDll), and screen lockers. TrickBot uses web injects to intercept banking credentials, harvests passwords from browsers and applications, performs Active Directory enumeration, and can deploy ransomware payloads."

  embedding_text: "TrickBot is a modular banking trojan and botnet platform that evolved into a multi-purpose malware delivery system. Originally designed for financial credential theft, it expanded capabilities to include network reconnaissance, lateral movement, and ransomware deployment. TrickBot uses a plugin-based architecture with modules for credential harvesting, web injection, Active Directory enumeration, and payload delivery. Commonly distributed via Emotet campaigns and malicious emails, it establishes persistence through scheduled tasks and serves as initial access vector for Ryuk and Conti ransomware operations. The malware targets Windows environments and enterprise networks."
