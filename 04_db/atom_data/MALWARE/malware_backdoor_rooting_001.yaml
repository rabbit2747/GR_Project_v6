# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Rooting Malware is a category of mobile backdoors that exploit vulnerabilities or use social engineering to gain root or administrator privileges on Android and iOS devices. These backdoors bypass operating system security controls, install persistent access mechanisms, and enable complete device compromise including access to protected data, system modification, and covert surveillance."
  why: "Attackers deploy rooting malware to overcome mobile OS security sandboxing and gain unrestricted access to device functionality. Root privileges enable monitoring of all user activities, access to encrypted data, circumvention of app permissions, and installation of system-level persistence mechanisms that survive factory resets."
  how: "Rooting malware operates by exploiting kernel vulnerabilities or privilege escalation bugs, using social engineering to trick users into enabling developer options or installing malicious profiles, escalating to root or system privileges through exploit chains, installing rootkits or system-level backdoors, modifying system files and boot partitions for persistence, disabling security features like SELinux or verified boot, and establishing covert C2 channels for remote control. The malware can survive OS updates and factory resets by infecting firmware partitions."

  embedding_text: "Rooting Malware encompasses mobile backdoors that gain root or administrator privileges on Android and iOS devices through vulnerability exploitation or social engineering. These backdoors exploit kernel vulnerabilities, trick users into enabling developer options, escalate privileges through exploit chains, install system-level rootkits, modify boot partitions for persistence, disable security features like SELinux, and establish covert C2 channels. The malware can survive OS updates and factory resets through firmware infection. Rooting malware enables complete device compromise, unrestricted data access, and covert surveillance. Detection requires integrity verification of system partitions, behavioral monitoring for privilege escalation attempts, bootloader security validation, and mobile threat defense solutions capable of detecting root-level compromises."
