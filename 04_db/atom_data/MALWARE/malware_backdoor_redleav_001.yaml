# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "REDLEAVES is a sophisticated backdoor attributed to menuPass (APT10) that provides comprehensive remote access, credential theft, and lateral movement capabilities. The malware uses DLL side-loading techniques for initial execution and establishes encrypted command-and-control channels for persistent access to compromised networks."
  why: "APT10 deploys REDLEAVES for long-term espionage campaigns targeting intellectual property and sensitive data. The backdoor's comprehensive feature set enables complete network compromise including credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration while maintaining operational security through encryption and anti-forensics."
  how: "REDLEAVES typically loads through DLL side-loading vulnerabilities in legitimate applications, establishes encrypted C2 using custom protocols, provides interactive shell access, implements keylogging and clipboard monitoring, harvests credentials from memory and storage, enables lateral movement through pass-the-hash and SMB exploitation, and exfiltrates data through encrypted channels. The malware includes anti-analysis checks and can update itself remotely."

  embedding_text: "REDLEAVES is an APT10 backdoor providing comprehensive remote access and espionage capabilities. It loads via DLL side-loading, establishes encrypted C2 channels, and offers interactive shell access, keylogging, clipboard monitoring, and credential harvesting. The malware enables lateral movement through pass-the-hash and SMB exploitation, supports data exfiltration, and includes anti-analysis features. REDLEAVES represents advanced persistent threat tooling with focus on credential theft and network propagation. Detection requires monitoring for DLL side-loading indicators, unusual SMB traffic patterns, credential access attempts, network anomalies in C2 traffic, and behavioral analysis of loaded DLLs. The backdoor's association with APT10 campaigns makes it significant for threat intelligence."
