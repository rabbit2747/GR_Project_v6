# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Hardware Trojan is a malicious modification or implant embedded directly into the physical circuitry, microprocessor design, or integrated circuits of computing hardware. These trojans are inserted during the manufacturing, supply chain, or design phases and operate below the software layer, making them extremely difficult to detect through conventional security measures. Hardware trojans can enable persistent backdoor access, data exfiltration, or sabotage capabilities that survive OS reinstalls and firmware updates."
  why: "Attackers deploy hardware trojans to establish persistent, undetectable access that operates below all software-based security controls. They target critical infrastructure, industrial control systems, military equipment, and sensitive government systems where long-term espionage or sabotage capabilities are valuable. Hardware trojans are particularly effective because they're invisible to antivirus, EDR, and most security monitoring tools."
  how: "Hardware trojans are implemented through malicious circuit modifications during chip fabrication, compromised design tools in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) workflow, or supply chain interdiction where devices are intercepted and physically modified. They can be triggered by specific input sequences, time-based conditions, or environmental factors. Once activated, they may leak cryptographic keys, alter computation results, create covert communication channels, or cause physical damage to systems."

  embedding_text: "Hardware Trojan represents malicious modifications embedded directly into physical computing hardware at the circuit, chip, or microprocessor level during manufacturing or supply chain phases. These trojans operate below the software layer and firmware, making them virtually undetectable by conventional security tools. They provide persistent backdoor access that survives OS reinstalls and software updates. Hardware trojans are particularly concerning in critical infrastructure, ICS environments, and national security systems where they can enable long-term espionage, data theft, or sabotage. Attackers compromise the supply chain through malicious foundries, intercepted shipments, or compromised design tools. Detection requires specialized hardware analysis techniques including side-channel analysis, circuit inspection, and functional testing."
