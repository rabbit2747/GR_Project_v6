# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "GandCrab was one of the most prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service operations from January 2018 to June 2019, evolving through five major versions with advanced encryption, evasion techniques, and affiliate program management. It used Salsa20 and RSA-2048 encryption, communicated via Tor, and was distributed through exploit kits, malvertising, phishing campaigns, and compromised websites. GandCrab operators claimed to have earned over $2 billion before voluntarily shutting down and releasing master decryption keys."
  why: "GandCrab operated as a highly profitable RaaS business model, providing sophisticated ransomware tools to affiliates in exchange for profit sharing. The operators continuously evolved the malware to evade detection, added features based on affiliate feedback, and targeted individual users and small businesses rather than large enterprises, maximizing infection volume and total ransom collection."
  how: "GandCrab is typically distributed through exploit kits (RIG, GrandSoft), malvertising campaigns, phishing emails with malicious attachments, and compromised websites. Upon execution, it performs anti-VM and anti-debugging checks, encrypts files using Salsa20 with RSA-2048 for key protection, modifies file extensions, deletes shadow copies, and displays ransom notes demanding payment in cryptocurrency (initially Bitcoin, later Dash). It communicates with C2 servers via Tor for key exchange and victim tracking."

  embedding_text: "GandCrab was one of the most prolific and successful Ransomware-as-a-Service operations, operating from January 2018 to June 2019 and evolving through five major versions. The operators claimed to have earned over $2 billion before voluntarily shutting down and releasing master decryption keys. GandCrab featured sophisticated encryption using Salsa20 and RSA-2048, Tor-based C2 communication, and extensive anti-analysis techniques including anti-VM and anti-debugging checks. It was distributed through multiple vectors including RIG and GrandSoft exploit kits, malvertising campaigns, phishing emails, and compromised websites. GandCrab operated as an affiliate program, providing ransomware tools to cybercriminals in exchange for profit sharing, with operators continuously evolving the malware based on affiliate feedback. Unlike many ransomware families targeting enterprises, GandCrab focused on individual users and small businesses to maximize infection volume. The ransomware encrypted files, deleted shadow copies, and demanded cryptocurrency payments initially in Bitcoin, later switching to Dash for enhanced privacy. GandCrab's operators are believed to have rebranded as REvil/Sodinokibi after their announced shutdown."
