# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "TeslaCrypt was a ransomware family active from February 2015 to May 2016, specifically targeting gamers by encrypting save files and profiles for popular video games including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, and Steam games. It evolved through multiple versions with improved encryption (AES-256, RSA-2048) and was distributed via exploit kits (Angler, Nuclear) and malvertising campaigns. The operators released the master decryption key in May 2016 and shut down operations."
  why: "TeslaCrypt targeted gamers because game save files and player profiles represent significant time investment and emotional value, making victims more likely to pay ransoms to recover irreplaceable data. The operators focused on volume attacks through exploit kits rather than targeted campaigns, aiming for widespread infections and smaller individual ransoms that victims could more easily afford."
  how: "TeslaCrypt is distributed through exploit kits like Angler and Nuclear that exploit browser and plugin vulnerabilities, malicious advertisements on legitimate websites, and phishing emails with malicious attachments. Upon execution, it performs anti-VM checks, scans for game-related files and documents, encrypts files using AES-256 with RSA-2048 key protection, modifies file extensions, and displays ransom notes mimicking CryptoLocker. Early versions had cryptographic flaws allowing free decryption, but later versions improved encryption implementation."

  embedding_text: "TeslaCrypt was a ransomware family active from February 2015 to May 2016 that uniquely targeted gamers by encrypting save files and profiles for popular video games including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, and Steam games. The malware recognized that game saves represent significant time investment and emotional value, making victims more likely to pay ransoms. TeslaCrypt evolved through multiple versions, improving encryption from weak implementations to AES-256 with RSA-2048 key protection. It was distributed primarily through exploit kits like Angler and Nuclear that exploited browser and plugin vulnerabilities, as well as malvertising campaigns on legitimate websites. The ransomware performed anti-VM checks, scanned for game-related files and documents, encrypted files, and displayed ransom notes mimicking CryptoLocker. Early versions had cryptographic flaws allowing free decryption, but later versions corrected these weaknesses. In May 2016, the operators voluntarily shut down operations, apologized to victims, and released the master decryption key, enabling free recovery of all encrypted files. This unusual ending distinguished TeslaCrypt from most ransomware operations that continue until disrupted by law enforcement."
