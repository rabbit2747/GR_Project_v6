# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Black Hawk is a web-based exploit kit that delivers malware through browser and plugin vulnerabilities. It targets Windows systems by leveraging security flaws in web browsers, Java, Flash Player, and other client-side software to achieve drive-by download attacks without user interaction."
  why: "Attackers use Black Hawk to automate the exploitation process for mass-compromise campaigns, enabling silent malware installation when victims visit compromised or malicious websites."
  how: "Black Hawk operates by hosting exploit landing pages that fingerprint visiting browsers, identify vulnerable software versions, and deploy appropriate exploits. Upon successful exploitation, it downloads and executes secondary payloads such as banking trojans, ransomware, or information stealers."

  embedding_text: "Black Hawk exploit kit delivers malware through browser vulnerabilities using drive-by download attacks. This web-based exploitation framework fingerprints victim browsers, identifies vulnerable plugins like Java and Flash, and automatically deploys appropriate exploits. When users visit compromised websites, Black Hawk silently exploits client-side vulnerabilities to install banking trojans, ransomware, or other malicious payloads without requiring user interaction. The kit targets Windows systems through web browser and plugin security flaws."
