# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Ares Loader is a commodity malware-as-a-service (MaaS) loader first observed in 2023, designed to deliver second-stage payloads including information stealers, remote access trojans, and ransomware. It employs multi-stage execution chains with process injection capabilities, anti-analysis techniques, and encrypted C2 communications to evade detection."
  why: "Threat actors utilize Ares Loader to establish initial access and deploy various malware families while maintaining stealth. The loader's modular architecture and obfuscation capabilities make it attractive for distributing diverse payloads across Windows environments, enabling attackers to monetize compromised systems through credential theft, ransomware deployment, or botnet enrollment."
  how: "Ares Loader typically arrives via phishing emails, malicious advertisements, or software cracks. Upon execution, it performs environment checks to detect virtual machines and sandboxes, then contacts its C2 server using encrypted protocols (often HTTPS) to retrieve configuration and payload. The loader injects malicious code into legitimate Windows processes using process hollowing or reflective DLL injection techniques, establishing persistence through registry modifications or scheduled tasks."

  embedding_text: "Ares Loader is a malware-as-a-service loader platform targeting Windows systems to deliver secondary payloads such as information stealers, RATs, and ransomware. First observed in 2023, it uses sophisticated evasion techniques including anti-VM checks, sandbox detection, and encrypted C2 communications. The loader employs process injection methods like process hollowing and reflective DLL injection to execute malicious code within legitimate Windows processes. Distribution vectors include phishing campaigns, malvertising, and trojanized software. Ares Loader establishes persistence through registry modifications and scheduled tasks, making it effective for threat actors seeking stealthy initial access and payload deployment capabilities across enterprise environments."
