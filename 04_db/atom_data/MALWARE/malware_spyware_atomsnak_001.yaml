# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Atomic Snake is a sophisticated multi-platform rootkit and espionage framework attributed to the Russian Turla APT group that operates at kernel-level to provide persistent, stealthy access with advanced anti-detection capabilities across Windows and Linux systems for long-term intelligence gathering operations."
  why: "The Turla APT group deploys Atomic Snake as their premier espionage tool for high-value intelligence targets including government agencies, diplomatic entities, defense contractors, and critical infrastructure organizations. The framework enables years-long persistent access for comprehensive data theft and network reconnaissance supporting Russian intelligence objectives."
  how: "Atomic Snake employs kernel-mode rootkit techniques to hide its presence, utilizing custom network protocols and encryption for C2 communications. It implements peer-to-peer network architecture for resilience, modular plugin system for extensibility, and sophisticated anti-forensics capabilities. The malware monitors system activities, captures credentials, exfiltrates documents, and maintains covert persistence through driver-level hooks and system modification."

  embedding_text: "Atomic Snake represents one of the most sophisticated nation-state malware frameworks ever documented, operated by Russia's Turla APT group for over two decades. The framework operates at the kernel level with driver-based rootkit capabilities providing near-complete control over compromised systems while evading detection. Its peer-to-peer command and control architecture enables resilient operations even when parts of the infrastructure are disrupted. Snake employs custom encryption protocols, advanced anti-forensics techniques, and multi-stage infection chains. The malware has been deployed against high-value targets across over 50 countries including NATO members, government agencies, and critical infrastructure. Its modular architecture allows dynamic capability updates including credential theft, document exfiltration, network reconnaissance, lateral movement facilitation, and long-term persistent access. The U.S. government conducted a significant disruption operation in 2023 to counter Snake infections across critical infrastructure networks."
