# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Bunny Loader is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform that emerged in September 2023, offering threat actors a versatile C2 framework with capabilities including information stealing, credential harvesting, keylogging, remote access, and secondary payload delivery. The loader combines multiple malicious functionalities in a single package, targeting Windows systems with focus on cryptocurrency theft, browser credential extraction, and system reconnaissance."
  why: "Bunny Loader provides cybercriminals with an affordable, feature-rich platform for conducting multi-objective attacks without requiring technical expertise in malware development. The MaaS model enables widespread distribution of sophisticated threats, allowing operators to steal credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and sensitive data while maintaining persistent access for deploying ransomware or additional malware families. The loader's modular design and regular updates make it attractive for both novice and experienced threat actors."
  how: "Bunny Loader is distributed through various vectors including phishing campaigns, malicious advertisements, software cracks, and compromised websites. Upon execution, it establishes communication with C2 infrastructure using encrypted protocols, performs system profiling and anti-analysis checks, then deploys selected modules based on operator configuration. The malware harvests credentials from browsers, email clients, and FTP applications, exfiltrates cryptocurrency wallet data, captures keystrokes, takes screenshots, and can download additional payloads including ransomware or remote access trojans. Persistence mechanisms include registry modifications, scheduled tasks, and startup folder entries."

  embedding_text: "Bunny Loader is a comprehensive malware-as-a-service platform introduced in September 2023, providing threat actors with integrated information stealing, credential harvesting, and loader capabilities targeting Windows systems. The malware combines multiple attack vectors including browser credential extraction, cryptocurrency wallet theft, keylogging, screenshot capture, and secondary payload deployment in a single package. Distribution occurs through phishing, malvertising, and trojanized software, with the loader establishing encrypted C2 communications for operator control. Primary targets include browser-stored credentials, email client passwords, FTP credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet files from popular applications. Bunny Loader represents the evolution of MaaS offerings toward all-in-one attack platforms, reducing barriers to entry for cybercriminals while maximizing potential financial gain from compromised systems through diverse monetization strategies."
