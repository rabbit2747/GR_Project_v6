# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Netsky is a prolific email worm family that emerged in 2004, notable for its aggressive propagation methods and rivalry with other malware families. With over 30 variants released within months, Netsky spread through email attachments, network shares, and peer-to-peer networks. The worm gained notoriety for containing code that specifically targeted and removed competing malware including MyDoom and Bagle. At its peak, Netsky variants accounted for a significant portion of email-borne malware infections worldwide, with Netsky.P being particularly widespread."
  why: "Netsky was created both for financial gain through establishing large botnets and apparently as part of competitive rivalries between malware authors. The worm's code contained taunting messages directed at the creators of MyDoom and Bagle, suggesting malware author competition. Its rapid variant releases demonstrated an attempt to evade antivirus detection while maintaining a dominant position in the email worm landscape."
  how: "Netsky spreads primarily through email with spoofed sender addresses and various social engineering subjects pretending to be delivery failures, security updates, or error messages. Upon execution, it copies itself to the Windows directory, modifies registry for persistence, and scans local files for email addresses. The worm sends itself to harvested addresses, copies itself to shared network drives, and attempts to spread via peer-to-peer applications. Some variants launched DDoS attacks or attempted to remove competing malware. Netsky also blocked access to antivirus and security websites to prevent removal."

  embedding_text: "Netsky is prolific email worm family from 2004 with over 30 variants, notable for malware author rivalry with MyDoom and Bagle. Spreads through email attachments with social engineering, network shares, and P2P networks. Contains code specifically targeting and removing competing malware. Establishes persistence through Windows directory infection and registry modification. Harvests email addresses from local files, sends copies with spoofed senders, blocks antivirus website access. Netsky.P variant achieved widespread infection. Features rapid variant releases for antivirus evasion, DDoS capabilities, and taunting messages to rival malware authors. Represents competitive landscape of early 2000s malware ecosystem."
