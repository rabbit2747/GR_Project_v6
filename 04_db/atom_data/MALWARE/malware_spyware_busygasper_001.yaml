# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "BusyGasper is a sophisticated Android spyware discovered by Kaspersky that provides comprehensive surveillance capabilities including SMS interception, call recording, keylogging, screen capture, location tracking, and clipboard monitoring while maintaining long-term persistent access through multiple evasion techniques."
  why: "BusyGasper is deployed by advanced threat actors for targeted surveillance operations against specific individuals, likely for intelligence gathering or espionage purposes. The malware's sophisticated design and comprehensive capabilities suggest state-sponsored or well-resourced threat actor involvement in monitoring high-value targets."
  how: "The malware gains initial access through social engineering and potentially physical device access, establishes deep system-level hooks for persistence, and deploys multiple data collection modules that operate continuously in the background. BusyGasper employs anti-analysis techniques, encrypts stolen data before exfiltration, and uses multiple C2 channels for resilience."

  embedding_text: "BusyGasper represents a highly sophisticated Android surveillance framework discovered during Kaspersky's investigation of targeted attacks. The malware demonstrates advanced development with over 100 different commands for comprehensive device monitoring and control. BusyGasper collects SMS messages, call logs and recordings, contact lists, GPS coordinates, browser history, clipboard content, keystrokes, installed applications, and device specifications. It implements screen capture capabilities for visual surveillance and can remotely control device functions. The spyware employs multiple layers of obfuscation, anti-debugging techniques, and encrypted communications to evade detection. Its modular architecture enables dynamic capability updates through C2 infrastructure. BusyGasper has been deployed in targeted surveillance campaigns with particular focus on specific geographic regions, suggesting intelligence gathering operations by well-resourced threat actors with access to advanced mobile malware development capabilities."
