# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "RobbinHood is a targeted ransomware family that gained notoriety for the May 2019 attack on the City of Baltimore, causing over $18 million in damages. It employs sophisticated techniques including vulnerable driver exploitation (Gigabyte driver) to terminate security processes by loading the driver into kernel mode and executing arbitrary code to disable anti-virus software. RobbinHood uses RSA-2048 and AES-128 encryption and has targeted municipal governments, healthcare organizations, and enterprises."
  why: "RobbinHood operators target large organizations, particularly municipal governments and healthcare facilities, that have critical operations and limited cybersecurity resources. The Baltimore attack demonstrated the ransomware's potential to cause massive economic damage and service disruption, with attackers demanding cryptocurrency ransoms while knowing that public sector organizations face pressure to restore services quickly."
  how: "RobbinHood attacks begin with initial access through compromised credentials, phishing, or exploited vulnerabilities. The malware loads the vulnerable Gigabyte driver (GDRV.SYS) with a valid digital signature, exploits it to execute code in kernel mode, terminates security processes that would otherwise block ransomware execution, encrypts files using RSA-2048 and AES-128 algorithms, and deploys ransom notes demanding Bitcoin payment. The driver exploitation technique allows RobbinHood to bypass endpoint protection."

  embedding_text: "RobbinHood is a targeted ransomware family that gained significant notoriety for the May 2019 cyberattack on the City of Baltimore, which caused over $18 million in damages and disrupted municipal services for weeks. The malware employs sophisticated anti-detection techniques using the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) method, specifically exploiting the Gigabyte driver (GDRV.SYS) which has a valid digital signature. RobbinHood loads this vulnerable driver into kernel mode, exploits it to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, and terminates security processes that would otherwise block ransomware execution. This technique allows the malware to bypass endpoint protection and anti-virus software. RobbinHood encrypts files using RSA-2048 and AES-128 encryption algorithms and demands Bitcoin ransom payments. The ransomware has primarily targeted municipal governments and healthcare organizations that operate critical services and often have limited cybersecurity resources. The Baltimore incident demonstrated the severe impact ransomware can have on public sector operations, with the city refusing to pay the ransom and instead spending millions on recovery and system rebuilding efforts."
