# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "LockBit is a highly sophisticated Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation featuring automated encryption, self-spreading capabilities, and anti-analysis techniques. Operating since 2019, it evolved through multiple versions (LockBit 2.0, 3.0/Black) with advanced features including StealBit data exfiltration tool, automated Active Directory compromise, and cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environments."
  why: "LockBit operates as a profit-driven RaaS affiliate program, enabling cybercriminals to deploy ransomware attacks with minimal technical expertise while sharing profits with the core development team. The double extortion model (encryption plus data theft) maximizes ransom payment pressure by threatening public data leaks on dedicated leak sites."
  how: "LockBit typically gains initial access through compromised credentials, RDP exploitation, or phishing campaigns. It performs automated Active Directory reconnaissance, uses Group Policy Objects for lateral movement, deploys encryption modules with multi-threaded file processing, exfiltrates sensitive data via StealBit, and leaves ransom notes with Tor-based payment portals. Advanced versions include anti-debugging, process termination, and bootloader manipulation."

  embedding_text: "LockBit is a highly sophisticated Ransomware-as-a-Service operation that has evolved through multiple versions since 2019, becoming one of the most prolific ransomware families. It features automated encryption with multi-threaded file processing, self-spreading capabilities via Active Directory and Group Policy Objects, and cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi. LockBit implements double extortion tactics, combining file encryption with data exfiltration through the StealBit tool, threatening victims with public data leaks if ransoms are not paid. The malware includes advanced anti-analysis features such as anti-debugging checks, process termination, and bootloader manipulation. LockBit operates as an affiliate program, enabling cybercriminals to deploy attacks while sharing profits with the core development team. Initial access typically occurs through compromised RDP credentials, VPN vulnerabilities, or phishing campaigns, followed by automated reconnaissance and lateral movement."
