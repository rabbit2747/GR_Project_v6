# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "LemonDuck is a sophisticated, cross-platform cryptocurrency mining botnet active since 2019 that combines cryptomining with credential theft, lateral movement, and aggressive spreading capabilities. It targets both Windows and Linux systems, using multiple propagation methods including email campaigns, SMB exploits, and brute force attacks."
  why: "LemonDuck operators maximize profits by building a large-scale botnet that not only mines Monero cryptocurrency but also removes competing miners and spreads aggressively across networks. Its multi-faceted approach ensures persistent revenue generation and widespread infection."
  how: "LemonDuck spreads through phishing emails with malicious attachments, exploitation of SMB and RDP vulnerabilities, and brute force attacks on weak credentials. Once installed, it establishes persistence through scheduled tasks and registry modifications, deploys XMRig cryptocurrency miner, removes competing malware, steals credentials, and performs lateral movement using tools like Mimikatz. It maintains C2 communication for updates and command execution."

  embedding_text: "LemonDuck is a sophisticated cross-platform cryptocurrency mining botnet active since 2019, combining Monero mining with aggressive spreading and credential theft capabilities. It propagates through phishing emails, SMB and RDP exploits, and brute force attacks, targeting both Windows and Linux systems. LemonDuck deploys XMRig mining software while removing competing malware to maximize resource utilization. It performs lateral movement using stolen credentials and tools like Mimikatz, establishing persistence through scheduled tasks and registry modifications. The botnet maintains command and control communications for updates and remote command execution, representing a multi-faceted threat that generates revenue through cryptomining while building an expansive, self-propagating network of infected systems."
