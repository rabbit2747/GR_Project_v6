# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "RomCom is a multi-stage backdoor delivered through fake software update prompts and trojanized legitimate applications. The malware provides comprehensive remote access capabilities including file operations, command execution, screenshot capture, and data exfiltration, often distributed through watering hole attacks and social engineering campaigns."
  why: "Threat actors deploy RomCom to establish initial access through user deception and maintain persistent control for espionage and data theft. The fake update mechanism exploits user trust in software vendors and bypasses traditional security awareness training by mimicking legitimate update processes."
  how: "RomCom typically arrives through compromised websites displaying fake update prompts for popular software like browsers or PDF readers, downloads and installs trojanized installers that appear legitimate, establishes C2 connections to remote servers, downloads additional payloads and modules, executes commands and collects system information, captures screenshots and monitors user activity, and exfiltrates collected data through encrypted channels. The backdoor can self-update and download additional malware families."

  embedding_text: "RomCom is a multi-stage backdoor distributed through fake software update prompts and trojanized legitimate applications. It arrives via compromised websites displaying fake updates for browsers or PDF readers, installs seemingly legitimate but trojanized software, establishes C2 connections, downloads additional payloads, executes commands, collects system data, captures screenshots, monitors user activity, and exfiltrates data through encrypted channels. The malware exploits user trust in software updates and can self-update or download additional malware. Detection requires monitoring for suspicious download sources, certificate validation failures, behavioral analysis of installed applications, network traffic inspection for C2 patterns, and user education about verifying software update sources. RomCom represents social engineering-driven initial access vectors."
