# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "SocGholish (also known as FakeUpdates) is a sophisticated JavaScript-based malware framework operated by the threat group Evil Corp (TA569), first observed in 2018. The framework delivers malware through fake browser update notifications displayed on compromised websites, serving as initial access for deploying ransomware (WastedLocker, Hades, BitPaymer), information stealers, and post-exploitation frameworks like Cobalt Strike. SocGholish leverages website compromise, traffic direction systems, and social engineering to achieve widespread distribution."
  why: "SocGholish enables Evil Corp and affiliated threat actors to establish initial access across diverse targets through a scalable, automated distribution infrastructure. The fake browser update technique exploits user conditioning to trust and act on software update prompts, achieving high success rates while evading traditional security controls. The framework's primary purpose is to facilitate ransomware operations, enabling threat actors to deploy devastating payloads after conducting reconnaissance and lateral movement within compromised networks."
  how: "SocGholish compromises legitimate websites through various methods including exploiting Content Management System (CMS) vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or leveraging supply chain attacks against third-party components. Injected JavaScript on compromised sites detects visitor browsers and displays fake update notifications mimicking legitimate Chrome, Firefox, or Edge update prompts. When users click to update, they download a ZIP archive containing a malicious JavaScript file disguised as a browser update. Executing this script triggers PowerShell commands that download and execute additional payloads from attacker infrastructure. The framework performs fingerprinting, anti-analysis checks, and establishes persistence before deploying second-stage malware including NetSupport RAT, Cobalt Strike beacons, or ransomware. The attack chain includes traffic direction systems (TDS) to filter targets and evade security researcher analysis."

  embedding_text: "SocGholish, also known as FakeUpdates, is a sophisticated JavaScript-based malware distribution framework operated by the Evil Corp threat group (TA569) since 2018, serving as primary initial access for high-impact ransomware operations including WastedLocker, Hades, and BitPaymer deployments. The framework compromises legitimate websites to display convincing fake browser update notifications, exploiting user trust in software update processes to deliver malicious payloads. Attack chains involve website compromise through CMS vulnerabilities or credential theft, JavaScript injection to display fake prompts, and delivery of ZIP archives containing malicious JavaScript that executes PowerShell commands for payload download. SocGholish employs traffic direction systems to filter targets and evade analysis, performs system fingerprinting and anti-detection checks, then deploys second-stage payloads including NetSupport RAT and Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance before ransomware deployment. The framework's automated distribution infrastructure and high success rate through social engineering make it a critical component in financially motivated cybercrime operations targeting enterprises globally."
