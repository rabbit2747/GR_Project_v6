# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "DropBook is a sophisticated malware distribution technique first observed in 2023 that abuses Facebook's business and advertising platform infrastructure to deliver malicious payloads to Windows systems. The attack leverages legitimate Facebook services including Workplace, Business Manager, and advertising tools to host and distribute malware, exploiting user trust in the Facebook platform while evading traditional security controls that whitelist Facebook domains."
  why: "DropBook represents an innovative approach to malware distribution by abusing trusted cloud infrastructure belonging to major platforms. Attackers leverage Facebook's services because security solutions typically whitelist Facebook domains, allowing malicious downloads to bypass network security controls. The technique combines social engineering through fake job offers, software giveaways, or business opportunities with the technical abuse of Facebook's file hosting and sharing capabilities, creating a highly effective distribution mechanism that maintains high success rates."
  how: "DropBook campaigns begin with social engineering targeting victims through Facebook messages, posts, or advertisements offering attractive opportunities such as employment, free software, or business partnerships. Attackers lure victims to malicious Facebook pages or groups where they are instructed to download files hosted on Facebook's infrastructure, typically through Workplace file sharing or Business Manager document storage. The downloaded files are often archives containing malware loaders disguised as legitimate applications, PDFs with embedded exploits, or Office documents with malicious macros. When executed, these payloads deploy information stealers, RATs, or cryptocurrency miners. The abuse of Facebook's infrastructure provides attackers with reliable hosting, high-bandwidth distribution, and evasion of security controls that trust Facebook domains."

  embedding_text: "DropBook is an innovative malware distribution technique identified in 2023 that exploits Facebook's business and advertising infrastructure to deliver malicious payloads while evading security controls. The attack leverages Facebook Workplace, Business Manager, and advertising platforms to host and distribute malware, taking advantage of security solutions that whitelist Facebook domains. Campaigns employ social engineering through fake job offers, software promotions, or business opportunities posted on Facebook to lure victims into downloading malicious files hosted on legitimate Facebook infrastructure. The technique demonstrates living-off-trusted-sites methodology where attackers abuse reputable cloud platforms to distribute malware, bypassing network security controls and URL reputation systems. Downloaded payloads typically include information stealers, remote access trojans, and cryptocurrency miners disguised as legitimate applications or documents. DropBook represents a significant evolution in malware distribution by combining social engineering with trusted platform abuse, creating effective attack chains that exploit both technical security gaps and human trust in major technology platforms."
