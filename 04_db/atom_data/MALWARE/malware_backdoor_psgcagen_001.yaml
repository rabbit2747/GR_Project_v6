# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "PsGcat Agent is a sophisticated PowerShell-based backdoor that uses Gmail as a command-and-control channel, enabling attackers to remotely control compromised Windows systems through email communications. The malware leverages Gmail's API to receive commands and exfiltrate data while blending with legitimate email traffic to evade network detection."
  why: "Attackers deploy PsGcat Agent to establish persistent remote access that bypasses traditional network security controls. By using Gmail as C2 infrastructure, the malware exploits trusted email services, making detection difficult as traffic appears as normal HTTPS email communications."
  how: "The backdoor operates by periodically checking a Gmail account for commands embedded in email subjects or bodies, executing PowerShell instructions on the victim system, and returning results through email responses. It authenticates using OAuth tokens or application-specific passwords, maintains persistence through scheduled tasks or registry modifications, and can perform file operations, system reconnaissance, and lateral movement activities."

  embedding_text: "PsGcat Agent is a PowerShell backdoor using Gmail as command-and-control infrastructure. It leverages Gmail API to receive commands via email, execute them using PowerShell, and exfiltrate results through email responses. The malware authenticates using OAuth tokens, blends with legitimate HTTPS traffic, and evades traditional network security by using trusted email services. Key capabilities include remote command execution, file operations, system reconnaissance, and persistent access through scheduled tasks. PsGcat represents advanced living-off-the-land techniques that exploit legitimate cloud services for malicious purposes, making detection challenging without behavioral analysis and email traffic inspection."
