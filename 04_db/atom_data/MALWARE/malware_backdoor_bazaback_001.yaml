# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Bazar Backdoor is a sophisticated Windows malware developed by the TrickBot group (Wizard Spider), serving as a stealthy backdoor for high-value target networks. It provides advanced capabilities for network reconnaissance, lateral movement, credential theft, and acts as precursor for ransomware deployment including Conti and Ryuk."
  why: "Deployed in targeted attacks against large enterprises and organizations for financial gain through ransomware operations. Enables attackers to conduct extensive network reconnaissance, establish deep access, and prepare environments for high-impact ransomware campaigns maximizing extortion potential."
  how: "Initially delivered through phishing campaigns with malicious email attachments or links, establishes persistence through COM object hijacking or scheduled tasks, uses legitimate tools for stealth, communicates via HTTPS with domain generation algorithms, performs Active Directory enumeration, credential harvesting using Mimikatz-like techniques, and facilitates deployment of additional payloads including Cobalt Strike and ransomware."

  embedding_text: "Bazar Backdoor is an advanced Windows malware created by the TrickBot cybercrime group (Wizard Spider) for high-value targeted attacks. It serves as a sophisticated infiltration tool enabling extensive network reconnaissance, lateral movement, and credential theft operations. The backdoor is typically delivered through phishing campaigns and establishes persistence using COM object hijacking or scheduled tasks. Bazar employs stealth tactics using legitimate system tools and communicates via HTTPS with domain generation algorithms for resilient C2 infrastructure. It performs Active Directory enumeration, credential harvesting, and facilitates deployment of additional tools including Cobalt Strike and ransomware. Bazar Backdoor is frequently observed as a precursor to major ransomware deployments including Conti and Ryuk, targeting enterprises for high-impact extortion campaigns."
