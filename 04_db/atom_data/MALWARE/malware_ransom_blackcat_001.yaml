# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "BlackCat (ALPHV) is a sophisticated Ransomware-as-a-Service written in Rust programming language, making it highly portable and difficult to analyze. First observed in November 2021, it represents a new generation of cross-platform ransomware with advanced encryption capabilities, supporting Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environments, featuring customizable execution modes and extensive anti-analysis techniques."
  why: "BlackCat operates as a RaaS affiliate program pursuing financial gain through double and triple extortion tactics. Its Rust implementation provides superior cross-platform compatibility, memory safety, and performance compared to traditional C/C++ ransomware, while making reverse engineering significantly more challenging for defenders."
  how: "BlackCat gains access through compromised credentials, exploited vulnerabilities, or affiliate networks. It performs system reconnaissance, terminates security processes and databases, uses AES or ChaCha20 encryption with RSA-4096 key exchange, supports multiple execution modes (Safe Mode, Auto-spread), exfiltrates data before encryption, and deploys ransom notes with unique victim identification. The malware includes anti-VM detection, privilege escalation, and can modify boot configurations."

  embedding_text: "BlackCat (ALPHV) is a sophisticated next-generation Ransomware-as-a-Service written in Rust programming language, providing unprecedented cross-platform capabilities across Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environments. First observed in November 2021, it represents a significant evolution in ransomware development with superior portability, memory safety, and performance characteristics. BlackCat implements triple extortion tactics, combining file encryption with data exfiltration and DDoS threats against victims who refuse to pay. The malware features customizable execution modes including Safe Mode operation and auto-spreading capabilities. It uses advanced encryption with AES or ChaCha20 algorithms combined with RSA-4096 key exchange. BlackCat includes extensive anti-analysis features such as anti-VM detection, privilege escalation routines, and boot configuration modification. Operating as an affiliate program, it enables cybercriminals to deploy attacks with profit-sharing models. The Rust implementation makes reverse engineering significantly more challenging for security researchers."
