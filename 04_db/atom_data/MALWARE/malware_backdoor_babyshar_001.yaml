# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Baby Shark is a Windows-based reconnaissance backdoor malware attributed to North Korean APT groups, specifically linked to Kimsuky operations. It specializes in information gathering, system profiling, and establishing persistent access for intelligence collection targeting national security and foreign policy organizations."
  why: "Deployed in targeted espionage campaigns against think tanks, government agencies, and defense contractors. Enables initial reconnaissance, environmental assessment, and facilitates deployment of additional sophisticated malware payloads for long-term intelligence gathering operations."
  how: "Distributed through weaponized Microsoft Office documents containing malicious macros or HTA files, establishes persistence via registry run keys, communicates with C2 infrastructure using HTTP protocols with Base64-encoded data, performs comprehensive system enumeration including installed software, running processes, and network configuration."

  embedding_text: "Baby Shark is a reconnaissance-focused backdoor malware attributed to North Korean APT groups, particularly Kimsuky operations. It targets think tanks, government agencies, and defense contractors for cyber espionage. The malware is typically delivered through weaponized Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros or HTML Application files. Baby Shark establishes persistence through registry modifications and communicates with command-and-control servers using HTTP protocols with Base64-encoded data transmission. Its primary function is comprehensive system profiling including enumeration of installed software, active processes, network configurations, and user information. This reconnaissance data enables threat actors to assess target environments and deploy additional sophisticated malware tailored to specific intelligence collection objectives in long-term espionage campaigns."
