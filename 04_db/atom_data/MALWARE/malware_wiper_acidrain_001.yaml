# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "AcidRain is a destructive wiper malware discovered in 2022 that targets modems and routers, particularly satellite communication equipment. It gained notoriety for disrupting Viasat KA-SAT satellite modems during the 2022 Ukraine conflict, causing widespread communication outages across Europe by permanently bricking tens of thousands of devices."
  why: "AcidRain serves as a cyber weapon for causing large-scale disruption of communications infrastructure, particularly targeting satellite and network equipment to disable connectivity and create operational chaos during military operations or geopolitical conflicts."
  how: "AcidRain exploits vulnerabilities or uses stolen credentials to access target devices. Once executed, it systematically overwrites critical storage partitions, corrupts firmware, deletes configuration files, and destroys filesystem structures on Linux-based network devices. The wiper specifically targets NAND flash storage, rendering devices permanently inoperable and requiring hardware replacement. It operates quickly to maximize damage before detection."
