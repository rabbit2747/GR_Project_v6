# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "AcroTranscoder is Android spyware disguised as a video transcoding application that exfiltrates sensitive user data including contacts, SMS messages, call logs, and device information while maintaining persistence through legitimate-appearing functionality."
  why: "Threat actors deploy AcroTranscoder to conduct targeted surveillance operations against mobile users, leveraging social engineering through trojanized utility applications to gain extensive access to personal communications and device telemetry for intelligence gathering purposes."
  how: "The malware masquerades as a legitimate video transcoding tool, requests excessive permissions during installation, and establishes C2 communications to exfiltrate collected data. It employs stealth techniques including background service execution, encrypted communications, and legitimate app store distribution channels to evade detection."

  embedding_text: "AcroTranscoder represents a sophisticated Android spyware operation that disguises malicious surveillance capabilities within legitimate-appearing video transcoding functionality. The malware requests extensive permissions typical of media applications while secretly collecting SMS messages, contacts, call logs, GPS location, and device information. It establishes encrypted command and control communications to exfiltrate stolen data and receive operational instructions. The trojanized application maintains persistence through background services and employs anti-analysis techniques to evade mobile security solutions. AcroTranscoder exemplifies the trend of mobile spyware leveraging social engineering through utility applications to compromise user privacy and conduct targeted surveillance operations against Android device users."
