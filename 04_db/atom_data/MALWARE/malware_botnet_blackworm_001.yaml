# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "BlackWorm (also known as Nyxem) is a mass-mailing computer worm that achieved widespread infection in 2006 by propagating through email attachments and peer-to-peer networks. The worm is notable for its destructive payload that overwrites files with specific extensions on infected systems on the third day of each month. BlackWorm spreads by sending itself to email addresses harvested from the victim's address book and creates copies on network shares and removable drives. At its peak, it infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide."
  why: "BlackWorm was designed to cause maximum disruption through file destruction and rapid propagation. The worm's time-triggered payload ensured synchronized damage across infected systems, while its multiple propagation vectors maximized infection rates. Though not financially motivated, its destructive capability demonstrated the potential impact of mass-distribution malware on business operations and data integrity."
  how: "BlackWorm spreads through malicious email attachments disguised as legitimate files, exploits network shares with weak credentials, and copies itself to removable media. Upon execution, it modifies system registry for persistence, disables security software, and harvests email addresses from local files. The worm sends itself to collected addresses with social engineering subject lines. On the third day of each month, it overwrites documents with extensions including .DOC, .XLS, .PDF, .ZIP with meaningless data, rendering them unrecoverable. It also attempts to terminate security processes and block access to antivirus vendor websites."

  embedding_text: "BlackWorm (Nyxem) is a mass-mailing computer worm from 2006 that spreads via email attachments and network shares with destructive time-triggered payload. Propagates by sending itself to harvested email addresses, copying to network drives and removable media. Establishes persistence through registry modifications and disables security software. On third day of each month, overwrites files including DOC, XLS, PDF, ZIP with meaningless data causing permanent loss. Features email address harvesting, social engineering in messages, and security process termination. Infected hundreds of thousands of systems at peak, demonstrating mass-distribution malware impact on business operations and data integrity."
