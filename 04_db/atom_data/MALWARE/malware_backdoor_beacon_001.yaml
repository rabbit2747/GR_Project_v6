# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Beacon is the payload component of Cobalt Strike, a legitimate penetration testing framework widely abused by threat actors for malicious operations. It provides comprehensive post-exploitation capabilities including command execution, lateral movement, credential dumping, and covert command-and-control communications through flexible protocols."
  why: "Originally designed for authorized red team operations and penetration testing, Beacon is extensively weaponized by APT groups, ransomware operators, and cybercriminals due to its powerful capabilities, flexible C2 options, and sophisticated evasion techniques. Its legitimate origin provides initial trust and complicates detection efforts."
  how: "Deploys through various initial access methods including phishing or exploitation, establishes C2 using DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, or SMB protocols with malleable profiles for traffic obfuscation, implements process injection and migration for stealth, provides built-in tools for credential theft, lateral movement via PsExec/WMI, and supports reflective DLL loading for fileless execution."

  embedding_text: "Beacon is the payload component of Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, extensively abused by threat actors for malicious operations despite its legitimate security testing purpose. It provides comprehensive post-exploitation capabilities including command execution, lateral movement, credential dumping, and sophisticated command-and-control communications. Beacon supports multiple C2 protocols including DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and SMB with malleable profiles enabling traffic obfuscation. It implements advanced evasion techniques through process injection, migration, and reflective DLL loading for fileless execution. The framework includes built-in tools for credential theft and lateral movement via PsExec, WMI, and other Windows administration protocols. Widely utilized by APT groups, ransomware operators, and cybercriminals, Beacon's legitimate origin complicates detection while providing attackers with enterprise-grade offensive capabilities."
