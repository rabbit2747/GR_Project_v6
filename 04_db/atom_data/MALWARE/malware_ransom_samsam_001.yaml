# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "SamSam is a manually deployed, targeted ransomware operation that was active from late 2015 to late 2018, known for targeting healthcare organizations, municipalities, and educational institutions. Unlike automated ransomware, SamSam operators gained initial access through brute-force attacks on RDP services, exploited vulnerabilities in JBoss servers, conducted extensive reconnaissance, and manually deployed ransomware across networks for maximum impact. The operation generated an estimated $6 million in ransom payments before operators were indicted by the US Department of Justice."
  why: "SamSam operators targeted organizations with critical operations that could not afford extended downtime, particularly healthcare and municipal entities. The manual deployment approach allowed attackers to identify and encrypt the most critical systems, delete backups, and maximize ransom pressure. This big game hunting strategy focused on fewer but higher-value targets compared to mass-distribution ransomware campaigns."
  how: "SamSam attacks begin with gaining access through brute-forced RDP credentials or exploiting vulnerable JBoss applications. Attackers conduct network reconnaissance, identify critical systems and backups, escalate privileges, use tools like Mimikatz for credential harvesting, spread laterally via PsExec and SMB, delete shadow copies and backups, disable security software, and manually deploy ransomware payloads during off-hours to maximize damage before detection. SamSam uses AES-256 and RSA-2048 encryption and demands Bitcoin payments."

  embedding_text: "SamSam is a manually deployed, targeted ransomware operation active from late 2015 to late 2018, generating an estimated $6 million in ransom payments before operators were indicted by US authorities. SamSam operators specifically targeted organizations with critical operations including healthcare facilities, municipal governments, and educational institutions that could not afford extended downtime. Initial access was typically gained through brute-force attacks on RDP services or exploitation of vulnerable JBoss applications. Unlike automated ransomware, SamSam required extensive manual interaction with attackers conducting network reconnaissance, identifying critical systems and backups, escalating privileges using tools like Mimikatz, spreading laterally via PsExec and SMB, and strategically deploying ransomware during off-hours to maximize impact. The malware uses AES-256 and RSA-2048 encryption and demands Bitcoin ransom payments. Notable victims include the City of Atlanta, Colorado Department of Transportation, and multiple healthcare providers. Two Iranian nationals were indicted by the US Department of Justice for the SamSam operation, marking significant law enforcement action against ransomware operators."
