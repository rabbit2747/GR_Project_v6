# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Nemesis Gemina is a web-based exploit kit that delivers malware through browser and plugin vulnerabilities, particularly targeting Adobe Reader and Java Runtime Environment flaws. It operates through drive-by download attacks, compromising users who visit malicious or compromised websites."
  why: "Attackers use Nemesis Gemina to automate malware distribution campaigns, taking advantage of unpatched software vulnerabilities in common client-side applications to achieve widespread compromise with minimal interaction."
  how: "Nemesis Gemina hosts exploit landing pages that fingerprint victim browsers and installed plugins, identifying vulnerable versions of Adobe Reader, Java, and other software. Upon detecting exploitable configurations, it deploys targeted exploits to execute malicious code and download secondary payloads such as trojans, ransomware, or spyware."

  embedding_text: "Nemesis Gemina exploit kit automates malware delivery through browser and plugin vulnerabilities, focusing on Adobe Reader and Java Runtime Environment exploits. Operating through drive-by download attacks, it compromises victims visiting malicious or infected websites. The kit fingerprints browsers to identify vulnerable software versions, then deploys appropriate exploits to execute malicious code without user interaction. Upon successful exploitation, Nemesis Gemina downloads and installs secondary payloads including trojans, ransomware, and spyware. It targets Windows systems through common client-side application vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to achieve mass compromise through web-based attack vectors."
