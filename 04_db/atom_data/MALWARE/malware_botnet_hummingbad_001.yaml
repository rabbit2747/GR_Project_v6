# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "HummingBad is sophisticated Android malware that infected over 10 million devices worldwide, generating fraudulent advertising revenue through click fraud and installing malicious apps. Discovered in 2016, it employed advanced techniques to gain persistent root access on infected devices, making removal extremely difficult. The malware utilized chainfire exploits and sophisticated persistence mechanisms to survive factory resets. HummingBad could install arbitrary applications, display fraudulent ads, bypass Google's security protections, and establish backdoor access for additional payloads."
  why: "HummingBad was created as a large-scale mobile advertising fraud operation, generating millions of dollars per month through click fraud, fake app installs, and fraudulent advertising impressions. By rooting devices, attackers ensured persistent control and could monetize infected devices through multiple revenue streams including selling root access to other cybercriminals and deploying additional malicious payloads."
  how: "HummingBad initially spreads through malicious app stores, fake app updates, and drive-by downloads. Upon installation, it attempts to gain root privileges using chainfire exploits targeting vulnerabilities in older Android versions. Once rooted, it establishes persistence in the system partition, making removal require device reflashing. The malware communicates with command-and-control servers to receive instructions for fraudulent activities, installs additional apps from its own app store without user consent, generates fake ad clicks, and can steal user data. It employs obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques to evade detection by mobile security solutions."

  embedding_text: "HummingBad is sophisticated Android malware that infected 10+ million devices for advertising fraud and malicious app installation. Uses chainfire exploits to gain root access, establishes persistence in system partition surviving factory resets. Spreads through malicious app stores and fake updates. Generates revenue through click fraud, fake app installs, and fraudulent ad impressions. Communicates with C2 servers for instructions, installs apps without consent, creates fake clicks, and can steal user data. Employs obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques. Represents large-scale mobile fraud operation generating millions monthly. Difficult to remove due to persistent root infection requiring device reflashing."
