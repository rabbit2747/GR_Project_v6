# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Hidden Wasp is a sophisticated Linux malware toolkit combining rootkit capabilities, trojanized binaries, and cryptocurrency mining functionality. Discovered in 2019, it targets Linux servers and IoT devices with a multi-stage deployment that includes initial access trojans, kernel-level rootkits for stealth, and resource-hijacking cryptominers. The malware demonstrates advanced evasion techniques and modular architecture designed for long-term persistence."
  why: "Attackers deploy Hidden Wasp for dual purposes: establishing persistent backdoor access to compromised Linux infrastructure while simultaneously monetizing system resources through cryptocurrency mining. The rootkit component ensures stealth operations remain undetected by system administrators and security tools, enabling long-term exploitation for both espionage and financial gain."
  how: "Hidden Wasp operates through multiple components: trojanized versions of common Linux utilities (ssh, scp) for initial compromise, a kernel-mode rootkit that hides malicious processes and files from monitoring tools, deployment scripts that establish persistence via init systems, and XMRig cryptocurrency miner for resource exploitation. It uses process injection, library preloading (LD_PRELOAD), and kernel module techniques to achieve stealth and maintain control."

  embedding_text: "Hidden Wasp is a comprehensive Linux malware toolkit discovered in 2019 that combines rootkit technology, trojanized system utilities, and cryptocurrency mining capabilities. The malware targets Linux servers and IoT devices through multi-stage deployment beginning with trojanized versions of common utilities like ssh and scp. Once installed, it deploys a sophisticated kernel-level rootkit that hides malicious processes, files, and network connections from system monitoring tools. Hidden Wasp establishes multiple persistence mechanisms through init system modifications and achieves stealth through process injection and LD_PRELOAD library hijacking. The toolkit includes XMRig cryptocurrency miner for resource exploitation alongside its backdoor capabilities. Its modular architecture and advanced evasion techniques make it effective for long-term compromise of Linux infrastructure, combining both espionage and financial motivations."
