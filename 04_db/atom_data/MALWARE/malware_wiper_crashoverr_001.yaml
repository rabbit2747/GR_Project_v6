# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "CrashOverride (also known as Industroyer) is sophisticated ICS/SCADA malware framework designed to disrupt industrial control systems, particularly electrical power grids. Discovered after the December 2016 Ukraine power outage, it's only the second known malware (after Stuxnet) specifically engineered to attack industrial infrastructure, with capabilities to directly control power grid equipment."
  why: "CrashOverride serves as a cyber weapon for causing widespread power outages and infrastructure disruption. It represents nation-state level capability to physically impact critical infrastructure through cyber means, used in geopolitical conflicts to cause blackouts and societal disruption."
  how: "CrashOverride is a modular framework that includes components for reconnaissance, payload delivery, and ICS protocol communication. It implements multiple ICS protocols (IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, OPC DA) to directly control substation equipment, circuit breakers, and protective relays. The malware maps network topology, identifies control devices, sends commands to open circuit breakers causing power loss, and includes a wiper component to destroy system logs and firmware on SCADA equipment to complicate recovery. It can automatically execute attacks or operate via manual commands."
