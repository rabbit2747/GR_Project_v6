# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "BrickerBot is a unique destructive malware that permanently disables Internet of Things devices through Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS) attacks, also known as 'phlashing'. Unlike traditional botnets that compromise devices for criminal use, BrickerBot deliberately destroys IoT devices by corrupting their firmware, overwriting storage, and disabling critical system functions. First detected in 2017, it specifically targeted Linux-based IoT devices with default or weak Telnet credentials. BrickerBot's attacks render devices inoperable, requiring hardware replacement or firmware reflashing."
  why: "BrickerBot represents vigilante-style cyber activity aimed at removing insecure IoT devices from the internet. Some security researchers theorized it was developed to forcibly eliminate vulnerable devices that could be exploited by malicious botnets like Mirai. By permanently bricking insecure devices, the malware operators may have intended to reduce the attack surface available to cybercriminals, though this approach caused significant collateral damage to device owners."
  how: "BrickerBot scans the internet for exposed IoT devices with open Telnet ports, attempts authentication using default credentials or common passwords, then executes a series of destructive Linux commands. The malware performs storage device corruption by writing random data to /dev/mtd (flash memory), disables TCP timestamps, limits kernel connections, flushes iptables rules, and ultimately removes all iptables rules and deletes network configurations. These actions cause permanent system failure requiring hardware-level recovery. Unlike botnet builders, BrickerBot made no attempt to maintain access or control compromised devices."

  embedding_text: "BrickerBot is destructive IoT malware performing Permanent Denial of Service attacks by corrupting firmware and rendering devices inoperable. Discovered in 2017, it scans for Linux-based IoT devices with weak Telnet credentials, executes destructive commands corrupting flash storage, disables networking, and destroys system configurations. Unlike traditional botnets, BrickerBot makes no attempt to control devices, instead permanently bricking them requiring hardware replacement. Theorized as vigilante malware to remove insecure IoT devices from internet, potentially preventing exploitation by criminal botnets like Mirai. Targets routers, IP cameras, DVRs and embedded Linux systems with BusyBox. Represents unique destructive approach causing irrecoverable damage."
