# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Hello Bridge is a backdoor malware that provides remote access and command-and-control capabilities on compromised Windows systems. It establishes persistent connections to attacker infrastructure, enabling file operations, command execution, and data exfiltration. The malware uses standard Windows API calls and network protocols to blend in with legitimate traffic, making detection challenging through conventional security monitoring."
  why: "Attackers deploy Hello Bridge to maintain long-term access to compromised networks for espionage and data theft operations. The backdoor's design prioritizes stealth and persistence, allowing threat actors to conduct reconnaissance, move laterally, and exfiltrate sensitive information over extended periods without triggering security alerts."
  how: "Hello Bridge establishes C2 communications using HTTP/HTTPS protocols, often disguising traffic as legitimate web requests. It implements persistence through registry modifications and scheduled tasks. The backdoor receives commands for file system operations, process manipulation, and data collection. It employs anti-analysis techniques including environment checks and dynamic API resolution to evade detection by security tools."

  embedding_text: "Hello Bridge is a Windows-focused backdoor malware designed for long-term persistent access and covert operations. It establishes command-and-control connections using HTTP/HTTPS protocols that blend with legitimate web traffic to evade network monitoring. The backdoor provides comprehensive remote access capabilities including file operations, command execution, process manipulation, and data exfiltration. Hello Bridge achieves persistence through registry modifications and scheduled tasks while employing anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection. Its design prioritizes stealth and operational longevity, making it effective for espionage campaigns requiring sustained access to compromised networks. The malware uses standard Windows APIs and common network protocols to minimize its detection footprint while providing attackers with full system control capabilities."
