# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "CoinLoader is a pay-per-install (PPI) malware loader platform that emerged circa 2014, designed to distribute various malicious payloads with a particular focus on cryptocurrency mining software, information stealers, and banking trojans. The loader employs advanced evasion techniques including polymorphic code, anti-debugging mechanisms, and encrypted communications to install secondary payloads while remaining undetected on compromised Windows systems."
  why: "CoinLoader serves as a monetization platform for threat actors through multiple revenue streams including illicit cryptocurrency mining, pay-per-install affiliate programs, and distribution of credential-stealing malware. The loader's primary value proposition is its ability to install resource-intensive cryptocurrency miners while evading detection, allowing operators to monetize infected systems' computing power. Additionally, the PPI model enables other threat actors to distribute their malware through CoinLoader's established infection infrastructure, creating a cybercrime ecosystem."
  how: "CoinLoader typically arrives via exploit kits, malicious email attachments, software cracks, or bundled with pirated software. Upon execution, it performs environment checks to detect virtual machines and sandboxes, then establishes communication with C2 servers using encrypted protocols. The loader downloads and installs configured payloads, most commonly cryptocurrency miners targeting Monero, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies. It implements process injection techniques to hide mining activities, modifies system settings to maximize resource utilization, and establishes persistence through registry keys, scheduled tasks, and Windows services. The malware can also deploy information stealers to harvest credentials and banking trojans to capture financial data."

  embedding_text: "CoinLoader is a pay-per-install malware distribution platform that emerged in 2014, specializing in deploying cryptocurrency mining software and other malicious payloads to Windows systems. The loader serves as a critical component in cryptojacking operations, enabling threat actors to monetize compromised computing resources by mining cryptocurrencies like Monero and Bitcoin without user consent. CoinLoader employs sophisticated evasion techniques including polymorphic code generation, anti-debugging mechanisms, virtual machine detection, and encrypted C2 communications to maintain persistence and avoid detection. Distribution vectors include exploit kits, malicious email campaigns, software piracy sites, and bundled installers. Once executed, the loader installs configured payloads typically consisting of cryptocurrency miners optimized for CPU and GPU exploitation, though it can also deliver information stealers, banking trojans, and ransomware through its PPI affiliate program. The malware implements process injection to hide mining processes and modifies system configurations to maximize resource utilization while attempting to remain undetected by security software."
