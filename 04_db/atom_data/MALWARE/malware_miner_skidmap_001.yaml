# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "SkidMap is a Linux cryptocurrency mining malware that uses kernel-level rootkit techniques and replaces system libraries to hide its presence and maintain persistence. Discovered in 2019, it employs sophisticated evasion methods including loadable kernel modules (LKM) to manipulate system calls and prevent detection while mining Monero cryptocurrency."
  why: "Attackers use SkidMap's rootkit capabilities to achieve deep system-level persistence and evasion that survives reboots and resists removal, maximizing mining uptime and profitability while minimizing detection risk on Linux servers."
  how: "SkidMap typically compromises Linux systems through exposed services or weak credentials. Once installed, it drops a malicious loadable kernel module that hooks system calls to hide processes, files, and network connections. It replaces critical system libraries like pam_unix.so to establish a backdoor and maintain access. The malware installs XMRig miner for Monero cryptocurrency mining and uses various techniques to hide CPU usage from monitoring tools. Its kernel-level modifications make detection and removal extremely difficult."

Discovered in 2019, it uses loadable kernel modules to hook system calls, hiding processes, files, and network connections from monitoring tools. SkidMap replaces critical system libraries like pam_unix.so to establish backdoors and maintain access even after system updates.

SkidMap typically compromises Linux servers through exposed services or weak credentials, then establishes deep system-level persistence that survives reboots, maximizing mining uptime and profitability while resisting security tools and forensic analysis."
