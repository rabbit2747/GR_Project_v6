# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Ryuk is a highly targeted, human-operated ransomware that emerged in August 2018, known for demanding large ransoms from enterprises, government entities, and healthcare organizations. Unlike automated ransomware, Ryuk is manually deployed by sophisticated threat actors after extensive network reconnaissance and privilege escalation, specifically designed to maximize damage by encrypting backups, domain controllers, and critical infrastructure before deploying the final payload."
  why: "Ryuk operators pursue high-value targets for maximum financial gain, with ransoms often exceeding millions of dollars. The manual, targeted approach allows threat actors to identify and encrypt the most critical systems, delete backups, and ensure victims have no recovery options except payment. Ryuk has generated hundreds of millions in ransom payments, making it one of the most financially successful ransomware families."
  how: "Ryuk is typically deployed as the final stage of a multi-phase attack. Initial access is gained through phishing campaigns (often Emotet or TrickBot), followed by extensive reconnaissance, credential harvesting, lateral movement via RDP and SMB, privilege escalation to Domain Admin, deletion of shadow copies and backups, disabling of security tools, and finally manual deployment of Ryuk across critical systems. The malware uses RSA-2048 and AES-256 encryption, terminates processes, and leaves ransom notes named RyukReadMe.txt."

  embedding_text: "Ryuk is a highly sophisticated, human-operated ransomware family that emerged in August 2018, specializing in big game hunting attacks against enterprises, government entities, and healthcare organizations. Unlike automated ransomware, Ryuk is manually deployed by skilled threat actors after extensive network reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and privilege escalation. Attacks typically begin with Emotet or TrickBot infections providing initial access, followed by lateral movement via RDP and SMB, privilege escalation to Domain Admin level, and systematic destruction of backups and shadow copies. Ryuk operators carefully identify the most critical systems before deploying the final payload, maximizing damage and ransom pressure. The malware uses RSA-2048 and AES-256 encryption, terminates critical processes, and leaves RyukReadMe.txt ransom notes. Ryuk attacks have demanded ransoms exceeding millions of dollars, making it one of the most financially successful ransomware operations. The threat actor behind Ryuk, known as Wizard Spider, has generated hundreds of millions in ransom payments by targeting high-value organizations with limited recovery options."
