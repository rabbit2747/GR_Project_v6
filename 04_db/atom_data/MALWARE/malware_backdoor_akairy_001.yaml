# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Akairy is a cross-platform backdoor malware supporting both Windows and Linux environments, designed for initial access and network reconnaissance. It provides remote command execution, system enumeration, and establishes covert communication channels for subsequent payload delivery."
  why: "Utilized by threat actors as first-stage implant for network infiltration, enabling reconnaissance activities, privilege escalation preparation, and establishing foothold for additional malware deployment in targeted environments."
  how: "Deploys through exploited vulnerabilities or social engineering, establishes C2 communication using HTTP/HTTPS with domain generation algorithms, performs system reconnaissance including network mapping and credential enumeration, and maintains persistence through service installation or cron jobs."

  embedding_text: "Akairy is a cross-platform backdoor malware capable of operating on both Windows and Linux systems. It serves as an initial access tool providing remote command execution and system enumeration capabilities. The malware establishes covert command-and-control communications using HTTP/HTTPS protocols with domain generation algorithms for resilient C2 infrastructure. Akairy performs comprehensive network reconnaissance including system information gathering, network mapping, and credential enumeration. It maintains persistence through service installation on Windows or cron job scheduling on Linux systems. Primarily deployed as a first-stage implant by threat actors for network infiltration, enabling privilege escalation preparation and establishing footholds for additional malware deployment in targeted enterprise environments."
