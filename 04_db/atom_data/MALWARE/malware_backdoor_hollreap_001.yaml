# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Hollow Reaper is a backdoor malware that leverages process hollowing techniques to inject malicious code into legitimate Windows processes. It creates suspended instances of trusted executables, replaces their memory content with malicious payloads, and resumes execution, thereby inheriting the legitimate process's security context and evading process-based detection. This technique allows the malware to hide within processes that appear benign to security monitoring."
  why: "Attackers use Hollow Reaper to evade detection by security tools that whitelist or trust legitimate system processes. By executing malicious code within the context of trusted applications like svchost.exe or explorer.exe, the malware bypasses application whitelisting, endpoint detection, and behavior analysis systems that rely on process reputation. This provides stealthy execution and persistence."
  how: "Hollow Reaper employs the classic process hollowing technique: creating a legitimate process in suspended state using CREATE_SUSPENDED flag, unmapping its memory sections with NtUnmapViewOfSection, allocating new memory and writing malicious code, updating the process entry point, and resuming execution. The malware carefully selects target processes that are commonly running and trusted, uses anti-debugging checks, and may employ additional obfuscation to avoid memory scanning."

  embedding_text: "Hollow Reaper is a backdoor malware utilizing process hollowing (RunPE) techniques to inject and execute malicious code within legitimate Windows processes. It creates suspended instances of trusted executables such as svchost.exe or explorer.exe, unmaps their original memory content, writes malicious payload into the hollowed process space, and resumes execution with the malicious code running under the legitimate process identity. This sophisticated evasion technique allows the malware to bypass application whitelisting, evade process-based detection mechanisms, and operate with the security context and reputation of trusted system processes. Hollow Reaper carefully selects target processes, implements anti-debugging measures, and may use additional obfuscation techniques to avoid memory scanning and behavioral analysis. The technique is effective against traditional security tools that rely on process names and signatures for threat detection."
