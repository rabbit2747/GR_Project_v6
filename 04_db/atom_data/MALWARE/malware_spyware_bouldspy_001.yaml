# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Boulder Spy is Android surveillance malware that focuses on comprehensive messaging application data theft, extracting communications from popular platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and others while collecting device information, contacts, and location data for targeted surveillance operations."
  why: "Threat actors deploy Boulder Spy to conduct targeted surveillance against individuals using encrypted messaging platforms, bypassing end-to-end encryption by stealing data directly from the device before encryption or after decryption, typically for intelligence gathering, corporate espionage, or law enforcement bypass."
  how: "The malware masquerades as legitimate applications to gain installation access, requests extensive permissions including accessibility services, and monitors messaging application databases and storage locations to extract plaintext messages, media files, and metadata. It establishes C2 communications for data exfiltration and remote control capabilities."

  embedding_text: "Boulder Spy represents a targeted Android surveillance operation focusing specifically on encrypted messaging application data theft. The malware demonstrates sophisticated capabilities in accessing messaging databases from multiple platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, WeChat, and Facebook Messenger by exploiting Android's accessibility services and file system permissions. Boulder Spy bypasses end-to-end encryption by stealing data at the endpoint level where messages exist in plaintext form on the device. The spyware collects message content, media attachments, contact information, chat metadata, and voice recordings. It maintains persistence through system service installation and employs stealth techniques to avoid detection. Boulder Spy has been observed in targeted surveillance campaigns against journalists, activists, political dissidents, and corporate executives, highlighting the ongoing threat to secure communications from endpoint-level surveillance malware."
