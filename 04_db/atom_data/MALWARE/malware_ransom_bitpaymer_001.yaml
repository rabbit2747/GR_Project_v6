# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "BitPaymer is a targeted ransomware family attributed to the Russian threat group INDRIK SPIDER (Wizard Spider), active since mid-2017. It represents one of the first examples of big game hunting ransomware, specifically targeting large enterprises, healthcare organizations, and government entities for high-value ransoms. BitPaymer is manually deployed after extensive network reconnaissance and uses RSA and RC4 encryption algorithms to encrypt files, with each victim receiving a unique binary compiled specifically for their organization."
  why: "BitPaymer operators focus on big game hunting to maximize financial gain through large ransom demands from organizations that can afford to pay significant sums. The manual, targeted approach allows attackers to identify the most critical systems, assess the victim's ability to pay, and customize ransomware binaries to evade detection and complicate analysis by security researchers."
  how: "BitPaymer attacks typically begin with Dridex banking trojan infections providing initial access, followed by extensive network reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement via RDP and SMB, privilege escalation to Domain Admin, and manual deployment of customized ransomware binaries. The malware uses RC4 and RSA encryption, terminates processes and services, deletes shadow copies, and leaves ransom notes with victim-specific payment instructions and Tor-based communication channels. Each binary is uniquely compiled per victim to evade signature-based detection."

  embedding_text: "BitPaymer is a targeted ransomware family attributed to the Russian threat group INDRIK SPIDER (Wizard Spider), active since mid-2017 and representing one of the first examples of big game hunting ransomware tactics. The malware specifically targets large enterprises, healthcare organizations, and government entities for high-value ransom demands. BitPaymer attacks typically begin with Dridex banking trojan infections providing initial access, followed by extensive network reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, and privilege escalation before manual deployment of customized ransomware binaries. A unique characteristic is that each victim receives a specifically compiled binary tailored to their environment, making signature-based detection difficult. BitPaymer uses RC4 and RSA encryption algorithms, terminates critical processes and services, deletes shadow copies and backups, and leaves ransom notes with victim-specific payment instructions via Tor-based channels. The manual deployment approach allows attackers to identify and encrypt the most critical systems while maximizing ransom pressure. BitPaymer later evolved into WastedLocker and DoppelPaymer variants, demonstrating the ongoing development of the INDRIK SPIDER threat group's ransomware capabilities. The success of BitPaymer's big game hunting model influenced numerous subsequent ransomware operations."
