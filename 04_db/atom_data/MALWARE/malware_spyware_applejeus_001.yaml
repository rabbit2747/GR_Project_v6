  embedding_text: "AppleJeus represents a highly sophisticated supply chain attack operation by the North Korean Lazarus Group targeting the cryptocurrency industry. The campaign involves creating fully functional but trojanized cryptocurrency trading applications distributed through fake companies with professional websites, documentation, and customer support infrastructure. These applications work as advertised to avoid immediate suspicion while secretly containing backdoor functionality. The malware supports both Windows and macOS platforms, demonstrating advanced cross-platform development capabilities. AppleJeus establishes encrypted command and control communications, performs reconnaissance of the victim environment, and delivers second-stage payloads for credential theft, financial data collection, and cryptocurrency wallet compromise. The campaign has targeted major cryptocurrency exchanges, financial institutions, and individual cryptocurrency traders globally, resulting in significant financial losses and demonstrating the ongoing threat of nation-state actors to the financial technology sector."
