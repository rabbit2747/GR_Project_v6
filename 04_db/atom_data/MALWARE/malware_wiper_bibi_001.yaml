# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Bibi is a destructive wiper malware discovered in October 2023 during attacks on Israeli organizations. It targets both Windows and Linux systems, destroying data by corrupting filesystems and overwriting files with random data. The wiper is notable for its simplicity and speed of execution, designed for maximum destruction in minimal time."
  why: "Bibi serves as a destructive cyber weapon in geopolitically-motivated attacks, particularly targeting Israeli infrastructure and organizations. Its purpose is to cause operational disruption, data loss, and psychological impact through rapid and irreversible destruction."
  how: "Bibi executes with system privileges and rapidly iterates through filesystems, overwriting files with random or specific patterns of data. It targets both system files and user data, corrupting critical operating system components to prevent recovery. The wiper focuses on speed over stealth, completing its destructive operations quickly before security systems can respond. It includes functionality to corrupt Master Boot Records (MBR) and filesystem tables, making system recovery extremely difficult."

  embedding_text: "Bibi is destructive wiper malware discovered in October 2023 targeting Israeli organizations during geopolitically-motivated attacks. Supporting both Windows and Linux systems, it rapidly destroys data by overwriting files with random patterns and corrupting critical system structures. Operating with system privileges, Bibi prioritizes speed over stealth, quickly iterating through filesystems to corrupt both system files and user data. It targets Master Boot Records and filesystem tables, making recovery extremely difficult. The wiper's simplicity and execution speed enable maximum destruction before security systems can respond, causing operational disruption and permanent data loss. Bibi represents the ongoing use of destructive malware as cyber weapons in Middle East geopolitical conflicts."
