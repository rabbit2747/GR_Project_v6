# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "WannaCry is a crypto-ransomware worm that exploited the EternalBlue SMB vulnerability (MS17-010) to spread rapidly across networks, encrypting files and demanding Bitcoin ransom payments. It became notorious for the May 2017 global outbreak affecting over 200,000 computers across 150 countries, targeting healthcare, telecommunications, and critical infrastructure sectors."
  why: "WannaCry was deployed for financial gain through ransom extortion, leveraging a leaked NSA exploit to achieve unprecedented propagation speed. Its worm-like capability allowed autonomous spreading without user interaction, maximizing impact and ransom collection potential across vulnerable Windows systems."
  how: "WannaCry exploits EternalBlue vulnerability in SMBv1 to gain remote code execution, installs ransomware payload using DoublePulsar backdoor, encrypts files using AES-128 encryption, spreads laterally via SMB scanning, and displays ransom demand with Bitcoin payment instructions. It includes a kill switch domain that halted initial outbreak when registered."

  embedding_text: "WannaCry is a notorious crypto-ransomware worm that exploited the EternalBlue SMB vulnerability to achieve global propagation in May 2017. It encrypts victim files using AES-128 encryption and demands Bitcoin ransom payments. The malware spreads autonomously across networks by scanning for vulnerable SMB services, gaining remote code execution through MS17-010, and installing the ransomware payload via DoublePulsar backdoor. WannaCry affected over 200,000 systems across 150 countries, impacting healthcare, telecommunications, and critical infrastructure. Its worm-like capability enabled rapid lateral movement without user interaction. The initial outbreak was halted when security researchers registered the hardcoded kill switch domain. WannaCry demonstrates the catastrophic impact of unpatched vulnerabilities combined with self-propagating malware capabilities, targeting Windows systems across enterprise networks."
