# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Drip Loader, also known as Trojan:Win32/Dripex, is a malware loader first observed in 2023 designed to deliver secondary payloads including information stealers, ransomware, and remote access trojans to compromised Windows systems. The loader employs multi-stage execution chains, process injection techniques, and encrypted C2 communications to evade detection while establishing persistent access for deploying additional malware families."
  why: "Drip Loader enables threat actors to establish initial access and maintain flexibility in payload deployment across compromised systems. The loader's modular architecture allows operators to adapt to changing objectives by deploying different malware families based on target value and campaign goals. Its evasion capabilities and persistence mechanisms make it effective for maintaining long-term access in enterprise environments while evading endpoint detection and response systems."
  how: "Drip Loader typically arrives through phishing campaigns, malicious advertisements, or software bundling. Upon execution, it performs anti-analysis checks including virtual machine detection and sandbox identification, then establishes C2 communication using encrypted protocols (typically HTTPS) to retrieve configuration and payload information. The loader uses process injection techniques such as process hollowing or reflective DLL injection to execute malicious code within legitimate Windows processes. It establishes persistence through registry Run keys, scheduled tasks, or Windows service modifications. The malware can download and execute various second-stage payloads based on C2 instructions, supporting information stealers, banking trojans, and ransomware delivery."

  embedding_text: "Drip Loader is a Windows-targeting malware loader identified in 2023, designed to deliver diverse secondary payloads including information stealers, ransomware, and remote access trojans through multi-stage execution chains. The loader employs sophisticated evasion techniques such as anti-VM checks, sandbox detection, and encrypted C2 communications to avoid security analysis. Distribution vectors include phishing campaigns, malvertising, and software bundling, with the malware establishing initial access before deploying selected payloads. Technical capabilities include process injection methods like process hollowing and reflective DLL injection to hide malicious code within legitimate Windows processes. Persistence mechanisms leverage registry Run keys, scheduled tasks, and Windows service modifications. The modular architecture enables threat actors to adapt payload selection based on target environment and campaign objectives, making Drip Loader a versatile tool for initial access and malware distribution across enterprise networks."
