# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "PSHLSpy is a PowerShell-based backdoor malware that provides remote access and surveillance capabilities on compromised Windows systems. The malware operates entirely in memory using PowerShell scripts to avoid file-based detection, enabling command execution, data collection, and system reconnaissance."
  why: "Threat actors deploy PSHLSpy to establish covert access to Windows environments while minimizing forensic artifacts. By leveraging PowerShell's native capabilities, the malware evades traditional antivirus solutions and blends with legitimate administrative activities, making detection and attribution challenging."
  how: "PSHLSpy loads directly into PowerShell memory through script injection or encoded commands, establishes C2 communication over HTTP/HTTPS channels, receives and executes commands from remote servers, collects system information and user data, and exfiltrates results through encrypted channels. The backdoor maintains persistence through registry modifications, scheduled tasks, or WMI event subscriptions."

  embedding_text: "PSHLSpy is a fileless PowerShell backdoor designed for stealthy reconnaissance and command execution on Windows systems. Operating entirely in memory, it avoids disk-based detection mechanisms and leverages PowerShell's native capabilities for system access. The malware establishes HTTP/HTTPS C2 channels, executes remote commands, collects system and user data, and maintains persistence through registry or WMI. PSHLSpy represents the growing trend of living-off-the-land malware that exploits legitimate system tools to evade security controls. Detection requires behavioral monitoring, PowerShell logging analysis, and memory forensics rather than traditional signature-based approaches."
