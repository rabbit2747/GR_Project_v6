# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "DarkSide is a sophisticated Ransomware-as-a-Service operation that gained notoriety for the Colonial Pipeline attack in May 2021. It features professional-grade double extortion tactics, selective targeting of high-value organizations, and a controversial code of conduct claiming to avoid hospitals, schools, and government entities. DarkSide operates across Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi platforms with advanced encryption and data exfiltration capabilities."
  why: "DarkSide was developed as a profit-driven RaaS operation targeting large enterprises and critical infrastructure for maximum ransom potential. The operators positioned themselves as ethical criminals with selective targeting policies, though the Colonial Pipeline incident demonstrated their willingness to disrupt critical services for financial gain, leading to their shutdown under law enforcement pressure."
  how: "DarkSide affiliates gain initial access through compromised credentials, VPN vulnerabilities, or exploited services. The malware performs extensive reconnaissance, uses PowerShell for lateral movement, employs Salsa20 and RSA-1024 encryption algorithms, exfiltrates sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers, terminates security processes and backups, and deploys customized ransom notes with negotiation portals. It includes language checks to avoid CIS countries and provides decryption tools after payment."

  embedding_text: "DarkSide is a sophisticated Ransomware-as-a-Service operation that gained global notoriety for the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack in May 2021, which disrupted fuel supplies across the US East Coast. Operating since August 2020, DarkSide featured professional-grade double extortion tactics, combining file encryption with data theft and threatened leaks. The operators claimed to follow a code of conduct avoiding hospitals, schools, and government entities, positioning themselves as ethical criminals, though this was contradicted by their critical infrastructure targeting. DarkSide supports Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi platforms, using Salsa20 and RSA-1024 encryption algorithms. The malware performs extensive reconnaissance, uses PowerShell for lateral movement, terminates security processes and backup systems, and exfiltrates data before encryption. After the Colonial Pipeline incident drew intense law enforcement attention, DarkSide operators shut down their infrastructure and later rebranded as BlackMatter. The operation demonstrated the severe real-world impact of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure."
