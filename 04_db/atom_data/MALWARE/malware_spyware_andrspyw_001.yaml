# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Android Spyware is a broad category of malicious software designed for Android mobile devices that covertly monitors user activities, collects personal information, intercepts communications, and exfiltrates sensitive data without explicit user consent or awareness, often disguised as legitimate applications or system services."
  why: "Threat actors deploy Android spyware for diverse motivations including intimate partner surveillance, corporate espionage, state-sponsored intelligence gathering, financial fraud, identity theft, and unauthorized monitoring. The widespread adoption of Android devices and permissive app ecosystem make them attractive targets for surveillance operations across all threat actor levels."
  how: "Android spyware typically infiltrates devices through social engineering, malicious app stores, trojanized legitimate applications, phishing campaigns, or exploitation of system vulnerabilities. It requests or exploits permissions to access sensitive device functions, establishes covert communication channels, implements persistence mechanisms, and continuously monitors and exfiltrates user data including messages, calls, location, browsing history, and media files."

  embedding_text: "Android Spyware encompasses a diverse ecosystem of malicious applications designed to conduct unauthorized surveillance on mobile device users. These threats range from commodity stalkerware available commercially to sophisticated state-sponsored surveillance tools. Common capabilities include SMS and call log interception, real-time GPS location tracking, contact list exfiltration, browser history monitoring, social media message collection, ambient audio recording, camera access, keylogging, and application usage tracking. Android spyware leverages the platform's permission system, often through social engineering or exploitation, to gain access to sensitive device capabilities. Distribution methods include third-party app stores, phishing campaigns, physical device access, and occasionally compromise of legitimate apps. The spyware category includes both targeted surveillance tools used in intimate partner violence scenarios and mass surveillance operations conducted by commercial spyware vendors or nation-state actors targeting dissidents, journalists, and activists globally."
