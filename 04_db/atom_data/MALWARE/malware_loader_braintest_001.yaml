# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "BrainTest is an Android trojan malware family first discovered in 2015-2016 that masqueraded as legitimate applications on the Google Play Store, infecting over 1 million devices. The malware disguised itself as popular applications including puzzle games, educational apps, and utility tools while secretly performing malicious activities including ad fraud, information theft, and installing additional malicious payloads on compromised devices."
  why: "BrainTest was designed to generate revenue through fraudulent advertising schemes while establishing persistent access to infected Android devices. The malware's ability to bypass Google Play Store security reviews and reach massive distribution numbers demonstrates the effectiveness of social engineering and code obfuscation techniques. Threat actors utilized BrainTest to monetize compromised devices through click fraud while potentially building a botnet infrastructure for future campaigns."
  how: "BrainTest infected devices through trojanized applications distributed via Google Play Store, often appearing as trending games or useful utilities. Once installed, the malware requested minimal permissions initially to avoid suspicion, then downloaded encrypted secondary payloads after launch. The malware employed anti-detection techniques including delayed execution, encrypted communications with C2 servers, and dynamic code loading. BrainTest performed ad fraud by simulating user clicks, collected device information, and could install additional malicious applications without user consent by exploiting Android accessibility features."

  embedding_text: "BrainTest is a notorious Android trojan that infected over 1 million devices through malicious applications distributed via Google Play Store between 2015-2016. The malware family masqueraded as legitimate applications including popular puzzle games, educational apps, and utility tools to bypass security reviews. BrainTest employed sophisticated evasion techniques such as delayed payload execution, encrypted C2 communications, and minimal permission requests during installation. Primary monetization occurred through ad fraud and click fraud operations, with the malware simulating user interactions to generate fraudulent advertising revenue. Secondary capabilities included device information collection and unauthorized application installation via Android accessibility service exploitation. The BrainTest campaign represents a significant mobile threat demonstrating the challenges of securing app distribution platforms against well-crafted trojanized applications."
