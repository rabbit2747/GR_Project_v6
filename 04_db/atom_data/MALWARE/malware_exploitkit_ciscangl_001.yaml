# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Angler Exploit Kit (misnamed Cisco Angler) was one of the most sophisticated and widely-used exploit kits from 2013-2016, delivering malware through browser and plugin vulnerabilities with advanced evasion techniques. It featured fileless infection capabilities, domain shadowing for infrastructure, and encrypted communications to evade detection."
  why: "Angler EK was highly effective for cybercriminal operations due to its technical sophistication, high exploitation success rates, and strong anti-analysis features. It was used extensively in ransomware campaigns and banking trojan distribution until its infrastructure was disrupted in 2016."
  how: "Angler operates through malicious advertising (malvertising) and compromised websites that redirect victims to exploit landing pages. It fingerprints the victim's browser environment, identifies vulnerable software versions, deploys zero-day and N-day exploits, and uses fileless techniques to execute payloads directly in memory, bypassing traditional antivirus detection."

  embedding_text: "Angler Exploit Kit was a highly sophisticated web-based exploitation framework operational from 2013 to 2016, known for advanced evasion and fileless infection capabilities. It delivered malware through compromised websites and malicious advertising, fingerprinting victim browsers to deploy appropriate exploits against Flash, Silverlight, and Internet Explorer vulnerabilities. Angler pioneered fileless techniques that executed payloads directly in memory, bypassing antivirus detection. It used domain shadowing to hide infrastructure and encrypted communications for stealth. Primarily used to deliver ransomware like CryptoWall and banking trojans, Angler represented the cutting edge of exploit kit technology before its disruption in 2016."
