# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "XOR DDoS is a sophisticated Linux botnet malware specialized in launching powerful distributed denial-of-service attacks. First identified in 2014, it targets Linux systems, particularly those with exposed SSH services and weak credentials. The malware derives its name from its use of XOR encryption to obscure command-and-control communication. XOR DDoS features rootkit capabilities to hide its presence, persistence mechanisms to survive reboots, and the ability to launch various types of network flooding attacks including SYN floods, DNS amplification, and ACK floods."
  why: "XOR DDoS is designed to build large-scale botnets from compromised Linux servers for conducting high-volume DDoS attacks for hire. Its targeting of Linux systems, particularly cloud servers and hosting infrastructure, allows attackers to leverage high-bandwidth connections for devastating DDoS campaigns. The malware's rootkit capabilities and encryption make it difficult to detect and remove, ensuring long-term botnet stability."
  how: "XOR DDoS spreads by brute-forcing SSH credentials on exposed Linux systems using dictionaries of common usernames and passwords. Once access is gained, it downloads and executes the malware binary, which establishes persistence through init scripts, cron jobs, and system service modifications. The malware installs rootkit components to hide processes, network connections, and files. It communicates with command-and-control servers using XOR-encrypted traffic on various ports. Upon receiving commands, infected systems launch coordinated DDoS attacks using techniques including SYN floods, ACK floods, DNS amplification, and other network layer attacks. The malware also implements process name obfuscation and anti-forensics capabilities."

  embedding_text: "XOR DDoS is sophisticated Linux botnet malware specialized in distributed denial-of-service attacks. Discovered in 2014, it targets Linux servers through SSH brute-force attacks using credential dictionaries. Named for XOR encryption used in C2 communication. Features rootkit capabilities hiding processes, files, and network connections. Establishes persistence via init scripts, cron jobs, and system services. Launches coordinated network layer attacks including SYN floods, ACK floods, and DNS amplification. Implements process name obfuscation and anti-forensics techniques. Primarily used for DDoS-for-hire operations leveraging compromised cloud and hosting infrastructure. Difficult to detect and remove due to rootkit components and encryption."
