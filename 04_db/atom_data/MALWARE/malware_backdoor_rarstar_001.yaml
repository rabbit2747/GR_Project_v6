# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "RarStar is a sophisticated backdoor that disguises malicious payloads and exfiltrated data within legitimate RAR archive files. The malware uses steganographic techniques to embed commands and data in archive metadata, comment fields, and encrypted sections, enabling covert communication and data theft while appearing as normal file compression activity."
  why: "Attackers use RarStar to evade DLP systems and file inspection tools that typically allow compressed archives to pass through security controls. By hiding malicious content within seemingly benign RAR files, the backdoor bypasses content filtering, reduces detection risk, and exploits the common practice of permitting archive file transfers in enterprise environments."
  how: "The malware operates by embedding C2 commands within RAR archive comments or metadata fields, extracting and executing these instructions on the victim system, collecting sensitive files and data, compressing them into password-protected RAR archives with steganographically hidden information, and exfiltrating through email, file sharing services, or web uploads. It can split large datasets across multiple archives and use encryption to prevent inspection."

  embedding_text: "RarStar is a backdoor that exploits RAR archive files for covert command-and-control and data exfiltration. It embeds commands within archive comments and metadata, extracts and executes instructions, collects sensitive data, and compresses it into password-protected RAR files with steganographically hidden information. The malware evades DLP systems and file inspection by appearing as legitimate compression activity. RarStar can split datasets across multiple archives, use encryption to prevent inspection, and exfiltrate through email or file sharing services. Detection requires deep packet inspection of archive contents, entropy analysis, metadata examination, and behavioral monitoring of compression tool usage. This technique exploits security controls that typically permit archive file transfers."
