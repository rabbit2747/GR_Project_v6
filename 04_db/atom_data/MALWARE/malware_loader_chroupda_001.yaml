# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Chrome Update is a social engineering-based malware distribution technique that masquerades as legitimate Google Chrome browser update notifications to trick users into downloading and executing malicious payloads. This attack vector leverages fake update prompts displayed on compromised or malicious websites, exploiting user trust in familiar software update processes to deliver various malware families including loaders, information stealers, and ransomware."
  why: "Threat actors utilize fake Chrome update campaigns because users are conditioned to trust and respond to browser update notifications, creating a high success rate for initial access. The ubiquity of Chrome browser usage provides a massive target base, while the technical appearance of legitimate update dialogs reduces user suspicion. This technique enables delivery of diverse payloads while bypassing traditional security controls that might block more obvious phishing attempts or malicious downloads."
  how: "The Chrome Update attack begins when users visit compromised websites or sites controlled by threat actors, which display convincing fake update notifications mimicking Chrome's legitimate UI. These prompts often include official-looking Chrome branding, warning messages about outdated browsers, or security alerts. When users click the update button, they download malicious executables or scripts disguised as update installers. The downloaded payload typically establishes persistence, deploys additional malware stages, and communicates with C2 infrastructure. Distribution infrastructure often involves website compromises through vulnerabilities, malicious advertising networks, or SEO poisoning to drive traffic to fake update pages."

  embedding_text: "Chrome Update is a prevalent social engineering attack technique that exploits user trust in software update notifications to distribute malware. Threat actors display fake Google Chrome update prompts on compromised or malicious websites, mimicking legitimate browser update interfaces with official branding and convincing messaging about outdated browsers or security requirements. When users interact with these fake prompts, they download and execute malicious payloads including loaders, information stealers, ransomware, and banking trojans. The attack leverages multiple distribution vectors including compromised legitimate websites, malicious advertising networks, and SEO-poisoned search results directing users to fake update pages. This technique proves particularly effective because users are trained to respond promptly to software update notifications, and the fake prompts closely replicate Chrome's legitimate update UI. Chrome Update campaigns represent a significant social engineering threat vector that bypasses traditional security controls by exploiting user behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities."
