# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "CoinMiner is a generic category of malicious cryptocurrency mining malware that hijacks victim computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies like Monero, Bitcoin, or Ethereum without authorization. It consumes CPU/GPU resources, degrades system performance, and increases electricity costs while generating revenue for attackers."
  why: "Attackers deploy cryptomining malware as a monetization strategy that converts compromised computing power into cryptocurrency profits with lower risk compared to ransomware or data theft, operating silently to maximize mining duration."
  how: "CoinMiner infections occur through various vectors including software vulnerabilities, malicious downloads, phishing emails, and supply chain attacks. Once installed, it establishes persistence through registry modifications, scheduled tasks, or service creation, then executes mining processes that connect to attacker-controlled mining pools. It often includes evasion techniques to reduce CPU usage when monitoring tools are active."

  embedding_text: "CoinMiner malware hijacks victim computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies like Monero without authorization, generating profit for attackers while degrading system performance and increasing electricity costs. Distributed through vulnerabilities, malicious downloads, and phishing campaigns, CoinMiner establishes persistence through registry modifications and scheduled tasks. It executes mining processes that connect to attacker-controlled pools, consuming CPU and GPU resources. Many variants include evasion techniques that reduce mining intensity when monitoring tools are active to avoid detection. CoinMiner represents a low-risk, high-reward monetization strategy for cybercriminals, operating silently across Windows and Linux systems to maximize mining duration and cryptocurrency returns."
