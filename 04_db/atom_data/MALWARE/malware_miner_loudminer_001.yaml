# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "LoudMiner is cross-platform cryptocurrency mining malware that uses virtualization software (VirtualBox or QEMU) to run mining operations inside virtual machines, providing stealth and resource isolation. Discovered in 2019, it specifically targets Windows and macOS systems in the music production community by trojanizing audio software (VST plugins and applications)."
  why: "Attackers use virtualization to isolate mining activities from the host system, making detection and removal more difficult while providing a consistent mining environment across different operating systems. Targeting audio production software allows access to systems with high-performance hardware suitable for mining."
  how: "LoudMiner distributes through pirated or trojanized music production software, particularly VST audio plugins. Upon installation, it deploys either VirtualBox (Windows) or QEMU (macOS) virtualization software along with a preconfigured Linux virtual machine containing XMRig cryptocurrency miner. The VM operates in the background, mining Monero while the legitimate audio software functions normally to avoid suspicion. The virtualization layer provides evasion from endpoint security tools."

  embedding_text: "LoudMiner is cross-platform cryptocurrency mining malware that uses virtualization to achieve stealth and resource isolation. It targets music production professionals by distributing through trojanized audio software and VST plugins. Upon installation, LoudMiner deploys VirtualBox on Windows or QEMU on macOS, along with a preconfigured Linux virtual machine containing XMRig Monero miner. The VM runs in the background while legitimate audio software functions normally. This virtualization approach isolates mining activities from the host system, evading endpoint security detection and complicating removal. First discovered in 2019, LoudMiner represents an innovative approach to cryptomining malware that exploits both supply chain vulnerabilities in pirated software and the performance capabilities of audio production systems."
