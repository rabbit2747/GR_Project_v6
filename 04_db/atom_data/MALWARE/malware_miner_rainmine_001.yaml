# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "Rainbow Miner is a multi-algorithm cryptocurrency mining software that has been weaponized and distributed as malware to hijack victim computing resources for unauthorized cryptocurrency mining. While originally developed as legitimate mining software, it has been repurposed by attackers to mine various cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Monero, and others using both CPU and GPU resources."
  why: "Attackers weaponize Rainbow Miner's multi-algorithm capabilities to maximize mining profitability by automatically selecting the most profitable cryptocurrency based on market conditions and hardware capabilities, generating higher returns than single-algorithm miners."
  how: "Rainbow Miner malware is distributed through software cracks, pirated applications, malicious email attachments, or exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Once installed, it establishes persistence through scheduled tasks or autostart mechanisms, then configures itself to mine multiple cryptocurrencies depending on available hardware (GPU for Ethereum, CPU for Monero). It connects to attacker-controlled mining pools and may include features to reduce mining intensity when system monitoring is detected."

  embedding_text: "Rainbow Miner is multi-algorithm cryptocurrency mining software weaponized for unauthorized resource hijacking. Originally legitimate mining software, it has been repurposed by attackers to mine various cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and Monero using both CPU and GPU resources. The malware version distributes through software cracks, pirated applications, and system exploits, establishing persistence through scheduled tasks. Rainbow Miner's key feature is automated coin switching based on market profitability and hardware capabilities, maximizing attacker returns. It connects to attacker-controlled mining pools and may reduce mining intensity during system monitoring to evade detection. The multi-algorithm approach enables flexible cryptocurrency selection, generating higher profits than single-coin miners while consuming victim computing resources across Windows and Linux systems."
