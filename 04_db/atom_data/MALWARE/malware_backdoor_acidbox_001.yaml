# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "AcidBox is a sophisticated Windows backdoor malware providing remote access capabilities through encrypted command-and-control channels. It features modular architecture enabling dynamic payload delivery, credential harvesting, and lateral movement capabilities across enterprise networks."
  why: "Deployed by advanced persistent threat actors for long-term network access, espionage operations, and establishing persistent footholds in high-value targets. Enables covert data exfiltration and network reconnaissance."
  how: "Establishes persistence through registry modifications and scheduled tasks, communicates via HTTP/HTTPS with custom encryption protocols, employs process injection and DLL sideloading for evasion, and implements anti-analysis techniques including sandbox detection and debugger checks."

  embedding_text: "AcidBox is a Windows-based backdoor malware with sophisticated remote access capabilities. It establishes persistent access through registry modifications and scheduled tasks while maintaining encrypted command-and-control communications via HTTP/HTTPS protocols. The malware features modular architecture allowing dynamic payload delivery, credential harvesting capabilities, and lateral movement functionality. AcidBox employs advanced evasion techniques including process injection, DLL sideloading, sandbox detection, and anti-debugging mechanisms. Primarily deployed by APT actors for long-term network access and espionage operations targeting high-value enterprise environments. The backdoor supports remote command execution, file operations, system reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration capabilities."
