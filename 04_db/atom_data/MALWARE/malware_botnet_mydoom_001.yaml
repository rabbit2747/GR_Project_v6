# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "MyDoom is one of the fastest-spreading email worms in history, first appearing in January 2004. It propagates through email attachments and peer-to-peer networks, creating a backdoor on infected systems while simultaneously launching distributed denial-of-service attacks against specific targets. At its peak, MyDoom was responsible for approximately 25% of all email traffic worldwide. The worm contains functionality for both self-propagation and coordinated DDoS attacks, making it a hybrid threat that combines botnet capabilities with mass-mailing worm characteristics."
  why: "MyDoom was designed to establish a massive botnet for launching DDoS attacks while simultaneously spreading as rapidly as possible to maximize the size of the attack network. Its dual-purpose design allowed attackers to both compromise large numbers of systems and weaponize them for targeted attacks against specific organizations. The worm's email propagation ensured exponential growth while its backdoor component provided persistent remote access."
  how: "MyDoom spreads via email attachments with enticing filenames and social engineering subject lines, often appearing as error messages or legitimate notifications. Upon execution, it harvests email addresses from the victim's system, sends copies of itself to these addresses, and opens a backdoor on TCP ports 3127-3198. The worm also searches for files on peer-to-peer networks to propagate through KaZaA. MyDoom modifies system files, creates scheduled tasks for persistence, and coordinates with other infected systems to launch synchronized DDoS attacks against predefined targets using HTTP and TCP flood techniques."

  embedding_text: "MyDoom is historically one of the fastest-spreading email worms, appearing in 2004 and causing 25% of global email traffic at peak. Propagates via email attachments with social engineering and through KaZaA peer-to-peer networks. Creates backdoor on TCP ports 3127-3198 for remote access, harvests email addresses for propagation, and coordinates distributed denial-of-service attacks against specific targets. Features dual-purpose design combining rapid self-replication with botnet functionality. Establishes persistence through system file modification and scheduled tasks. Launches synchronized DDoS attacks using HTTP and TCP flood techniques. Represents hybrid threat combining mass-mailing worm characteristics with coordinated attack capabilities."
