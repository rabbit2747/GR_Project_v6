# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "NotPetya is a destructive wiper malware disguised as ransomware that caused massive global disruption in June 2017, causing over $10 billion in damages. Initially distributed through compromised Ukrainian accounting software (MeDoc), it spread rapidly using EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits, MimiKatz credential theft, and PsExec lateral movement. Unlike traditional ransomware, NotPetya's encryption was designed to be irreversible, making it a destructive cyberweapon rather than profit-driven malware."
  why: "NotPetya was attributed to Russian military intelligence (Sandworm/APT28) as a destructive cyberattack primarily targeting Ukraine, with collateral damage spreading globally. Disguised as ransomware, its actual purpose was data destruction and disruption of critical operations, causing billions in economic damage to multinational corporations including Maersk, Merck, and FedEx."
  how: "NotPetya initially infected systems through a backdoored update of MeDoc accounting software. It spreads laterally using EternalBlue SMB exploit, EternalRomance, stolen credentials via MimiKatz, WMI, and PsExec. The malware encrypts the Master File Table (MFT) and overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR), displaying a fake CHKDSK screen and ransom note. The encryption implementation was intentionally flawed, making file recovery impossible even with payment, revealing its true destructive nature."

  embedding_text: "NotPetya is a highly destructive wiper malware disguised as ransomware that caused over $10 billion in global damages during the June 2017 outbreak. Attributed to Russian military intelligence (Sandworm/APT28), it was designed as a cyberweapon targeting Ukraine with massive collateral damage affecting multinational corporations worldwide. NotPetya spread through a supply chain attack via compromised MeDoc accounting software updates, then propagated laterally using EternalBlue and EternalRomance SMB exploits, MimiKatz credential theft, WMI, and PsExec. The malware encrypts the Master File Table and overwrites the Master Boot Record, displaying fake ransom demands. Unlike traditional ransomware, NotPetya's encryption was intentionally flawed and irreversible, making file recovery impossible even with payment. This revealed its true purpose as a destructive wiper rather than profit-driven malware. Major victims included Maersk shipping, Merck pharmaceuticals, FedEx, and numerous Ukrainian organizations, demonstrating the catastrophic potential of nation-state cyberattacks against civilian infrastructure."
