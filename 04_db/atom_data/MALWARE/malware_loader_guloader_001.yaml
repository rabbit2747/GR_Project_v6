# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "GuLoader is a sophisticated Visual Basic-based downloader and crypter malware first observed in 2019, designed to download and execute secondary payloads including information stealers, remote access trojans, and banking malware while employing advanced anti-analysis and evasion techniques. The loader is distributed as malware-as-a-service (MaaS) and has been used to deliver numerous malware families including Parallax RAT, FormBook, Agent Tesla, and Remcos RAT across global campaigns."
  why: "GuLoader provides cybercriminals with a highly effective platform for distributing diverse malware families while evading detection through sophisticated anti-analysis capabilities. The loader's primary value lies in its ability to bypass security software, sandbox environments, and virtual machines through multiple detection and evasion layers. Its availability as a MaaS platform enables widespread adoption by threat actors with varying technical skill levels, making it a preferred choice for deploying information stealers and RATs in enterprise environments."
  how: "GuLoader typically arrives via phishing emails containing malicious attachments, often disguised as invoices, shipping notifications, or business documents. The initial stage is a Visual Basic script that performs extensive anti-analysis checks including sandbox detection, virtual machine identification, and debugger detection. Upon passing these checks, GuLoader downloads encrypted shellcode from compromised websites or cloud storage services (Google Drive, OneDrive), decrypts it in memory, and injects the final payload into legitimate Windows processes using process hollowing or process injection techniques. The malware employs various obfuscation methods including API hashing, string encryption, and control flow obfuscation to evade static analysis. GuLoader establishes persistence through registry modifications and can download additional modules or payloads based on C2 commands."
