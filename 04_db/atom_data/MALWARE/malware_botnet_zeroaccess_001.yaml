# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: "ZeroAccess is an advanced kernel-mode rootkit and botnet that infected millions of computers worldwide, primarily for Bitcoin mining and click fraud. Active from 2011-2013, it employed a sophisticated peer-to-peer botnet architecture making takedown extremely difficult. The rootkit operates at the kernel level, hiding files and processes from security software and the operating system. ZeroAccess modifies the Master Boot Record, infects the Windows kernel, and establishes a decentralized P2P network for command distribution, making it highly resilient to traditional takedown efforts."
  why: "ZeroAccess was created for financial gain through multiple revenue streams including Bitcoin mining on infected systems, click fraud schemes generating advertising revenue, and potentially renting botnet access to other criminals. Its peer-to-peer architecture eliminated single points of failure, making the botnet extremely difficult to dismantle. The kernel-level rootkit capabilities ensured deep system compromise and persistence against security tools."
  how: "ZeroAccess spreads through exploit kits targeting browser vulnerabilities, malicious downloads, and software cracks. Upon infection, it modifies the Master Boot Record for early boot persistence, installs kernel-mode drivers, and creates a hidden file system using NTFS Extended Attributes. The rootkit intercepts system calls to hide malicious files, processes, and registry entries. It establishes connections to a peer-to-peer botnet using UDP, where each infected system acts as both client and server. The malware receives updates and commands through this decentralized network, making it resilient to takedown attempts. ZeroAccess deploys Bitcoin mining software and click fraud modules, generating revenue while remaining hidden from detection tools."
