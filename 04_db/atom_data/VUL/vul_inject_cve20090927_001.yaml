# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2009-0927 is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Collab.getIcon()
    JavaScript method in Adobe Reader and Acrobat versions 9.0 and earlier. The vulnerability
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious PDF document
    containing a specially designed JavaScript call with an overly long argument to the
    getIcon method. The CVSS v2 base score is 9.3 (Critical) and it was actively exploited
    in the wild in 2009.
  why: >-
    Adobe Reader was installed on virtually every desktop computer at the time, making PDF
    files one of the most effective vectors for malware delivery. This vulnerability was
    actively weaponized in targeted attacks and drive-by downloads, serving as a primary
    initial access vector for advanced threat actors. The ubiquity of PDF files in business
    communications made social engineering attacks particularly effective.
  how: >-
    Attackers create a malicious PDF file containing JavaScript that calls the Collab.getIcon()
    method with an excessively long string argument. When a victim opens the PDF in a vulnerable
    version of Adobe Reader or Acrobat, the oversized argument overflows a stack buffer in the
    getIcon implementation. By carefully crafting the overflow payload, attackers redirect
    execution to embedded shellcode that installs malware, establishes backdoor access, or
    downloads additional payloads. Delivery commonly occurs via email attachments or
    compromised websites hosting malicious PDFs.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Stack Buffer Overflow"
      value: "Memory corruption on the stack caused by the getIcon method failing to check argument length before copying to a fixed-size buffer"
    - key: "PDF Weaponization"
      value: "Technique of embedding exploit code within PDF documents to leverage the trusted document format for malware delivery"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2009-0927 is a critical stack-based buffer overflow in Adobe Reader and Acrobat
    Collab.getIcon() JavaScript method with a CVSS score of 9.3. Remote attackers craft
    malicious PDF documents containing JavaScript that triggers a stack overflow through
    oversized arguments to the getIcon function. Actively exploited in the wild, this
    vulnerability was a primary initial access vector delivered through email attachments and
    compromised websites. The ubiquity of Adobe Reader made it an extremely high-value target
    for threat actors. Exploitation enables arbitrary code execution on the victim system
    when they open the malicious PDF. Mitigation requires updating Adobe Reader and Acrobat
    to patched versions and disabling JavaScript in PDF readers.
