# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2011-1255 is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8
    related to the handling of time elements in the DOM. The flaw exists in mshtml.dll where a
    CTimeElement object is freed but a dangling pointer remains accessible, allowing an attacker
    to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The vulnerability was patched
    in MS11-050 (June 2011). It affects Internet Explorer 8 on Windows XP, Vista, and 7.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant because Internet Explorer 8 was the dominant browser on
    Windows systems in 2011. Use-after-free vulnerabilities in browser DOM handling became a
    primary attack vector for drive-by download campaigns and targeted attacks during this era.
    The vulnerability allowed complete system compromise through a simple malicious webpage visit.
  how: >-
    The exploit creates and manipulates time elements in the DOM to trigger a use-after-free
    condition in the CTimeElement object. When the freed memory is reallocated with attacker-
    controlled data and the dangling pointer is dereferenced, it allows hijacking of the
    execution flow. Combined with heap spraying techniques, the attacker achieves arbitrary
    code execution in the context of the IE process.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "DOM Time Element Use-After-Free"
      value: "CTimeElement object in mshtml.dll is freed but dangling pointer remains, enabling code execution through heap manipulation"
    - key: "Browser-Based Remote Code Execution"
      value: "Visiting a malicious webpage triggers the vulnerability for full code execution as the current user"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2011-1255 is a use-after-free vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in Microsoft Internet
    Explorer 8 affecting the CTimeElement object in mshtml.dll. The flaw allows remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious webpage that manipulates
    DOM time elements, triggering a use-after-free condition. When the freed CTimeElement
    memory is reallocated with attacker-controlled data, dereferencing the dangling pointer
    enables arbitrary code execution. Patched in MS11-050 in June 2011, this vulnerability
    affected IE8 on Windows XP, Vista, and 7 and was representative of the browser DOM
    use-after-free attack class prevalent during this era.
