# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-32434 is a critical integer overflow vulnerability (CVSS 7.8) in the Apple
    XNU kernel affecting iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS. The vulnerability allows an
    application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges due to an integer overflow
    in kernel memory management. It was exploited as a zero-day in the sophisticated
    Operation Triangulation spyware campaign discovered by Kaspersky in June 2023. The
    attack chain used zero-click iMessage exploitation to deliver spyware without user
    interaction. Apple patched the vulnerability in iOS 16.5.1, macOS 13.4.1, and
    watchOS 9.5.2 in June 2023.
  why: >-
    CVE-2023-32434 was a key component of Operation Triangulation, one of the most
    sophisticated mobile spyware campaigns ever documented. The zero-click attack chain
    combined multiple zero-days (CVE-2023-32434, CVE-2023-32435, CVE-2023-38606,
    CVE-2023-41990) to achieve full device compromise without user interaction. The
    campaign targeted iOS devices of Kaspersky employees and others, demonstrating the
    advanced capabilities of nation-state level spyware operations. The exploit chain's
    use of undocumented hardware features in Apple chips was particularly unprecedented.
  how: >-
    The exploit leverages an integer overflow in the XNU kernel's memory management
    subsystem. When specific memory allocation requests trigger an integer overflow
    condition, the kernel allocates a smaller-than-expected buffer. Subsequent operations
    write beyond the allocated buffer, causing a heap buffer overflow in kernel space.
    In the Operation Triangulation chain, this vulnerability was used after initial
    code execution via CVE-2023-41990 (font processing) and CVE-2023-32435 (WebKit)
    to escalate from application-level to kernel-level privileges, enabling full device
    compromise and spyware installation.

    CVE-2023-32434 is a critical integer overflow vulnerability in the Apple XNU kernel
    with CVSS 7.8, affecting iOS, macOS, and watchOS. The flaw in kernel memory management
    causes undersized buffer allocations leading to heap overflow and kernel-level code
    execution. Exploited as a zero-day in Operation Triangulation, one of the most

    via iMessage without user interaction. Combined with CVE-2023-32435, CVE-2023-38606,
    and CVE-2023-41990 for full device compromise. Patched by Apple in June 2023.
