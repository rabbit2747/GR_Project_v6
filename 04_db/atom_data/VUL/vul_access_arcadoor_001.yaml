# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Arcane Door is a sophisticated espionage campaign discovered in April 2024 by Cisco Talos
    that exploited two zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA and FTD devices. CVE-2024-20353
    (CVSS 8.6) is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the management and VPN web servers that
    was weaponized to force device reboots enabling persistent implant deployment. CVE-2024-20359
    (CVSS 6.0) is a persistent local code execution vulnerability that allows pre-loading VPN
    clients and plug-ins enabling the Line Runner persistent backdoor. The campaign was attributed
    to a state-sponsored actor tracked as UAT4356 (Cisco Talos) and STORM-1849 (Microsoft),
    targeting government networks and critical infrastructure worldwide.
  why: >-
    Arcane Door demonstrates the critical risk of perimeter network device exploitation by
    advanced persistent threat actors. Network security appliances like ASA firewalls sit at
    trust boundaries and process all traffic, making them high-value targets. Compromise of
    these devices provides attackers with network-level access, traffic interception capabilities,
    and persistence that is extremely difficult to detect using traditional endpoint security
    tools. The campaign affected government and critical infrastructure targets across multiple
    countries.
  how: >-
    The attack chain used CVE-2024-20353 to crash the ASA web management interface, triggering
    a device reboot. During the reboot process, CVE-2024-20359 was exploited to execute the
    Line Runner persistent implant by abusing a legacy VPN client pre-loading capability.
    The Line Dancer in-memory implant provided initial access and command execution without
    touching disk. Line Runner achieved persistence through the VPN client pre-loading
    mechanism, surviving reboots and firmware upgrades. Indicators included unexpected reboots,
    unauthorized configuration changes, and anomalous authentication events. Cisco released
    patches and integrity verification tools to detect compromise.

    Arcane Door is a state-sponsored espionage campaign exploiting two Cisco ASA and FTD
    zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in April 2024. CVE-2024-20353 (CVSS 8.6) causes
    denial of service in web management servers enabling reboot-based exploitation.
    CVE-2024-20359 (CVSS 6.0) enables persistent local code execution via VPN client
    pre-loading. The Line Dancer in-memory implant provides initial access while Line Runner
    achieves disk-persistent backdoor surviving reboots and firmware upgrades. Attributed
    to UAT4356/STORM-1849, the campaign targeted government networks and critical infrastructure
    worldwide. Demonstrates critical risk of perimeter network device exploitation by
    advanced persistent threat actors.
