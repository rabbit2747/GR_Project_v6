# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Access Control Vulnerability is a class of security weakness where an application fails to
    properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do. This includes
    violations of the principle of least privilege or deny-by-default, where users can act
    outside their intended permissions. Ranked as OWASP Top 10 A01:2021, broken access control
    encompasses horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other users' data), vertical privilege
    escalation (gaining admin functions), missing function-level access control, and insecure
    direct object references. These flaws allow attackers to bypass authorization mechanisms
    to access unauthorized functionality or data.
  why: >-
    Access control vulnerabilities are the most common and impactful class of web application
    security flaws. When access control fails, attackers can view sensitive data belonging to
    other users, modify or delete data without authorization, perform administrative functions,
    or escalate from a low-privilege account to full system control. The impact ranges from
    data breaches and compliance violations to complete system compromise.
  how: >-
    These vulnerabilities arise from improper implementation of authorization checks in
    application code. Common patterns include modifying URL parameters or API requests to
    access other accounts, elevating roles by manipulating tokens or cookies, metadata
    manipulation such as replaying or tampering with JWT access tokens, CORS misconfiguration
    allowing unauthorized API access, force browsing to authenticated pages as an
    unauthenticated user, and missing access control checks in API endpoints. Mitigation
    requires implementing server-side access control, denying by default, enforcing record
    ownership, logging access control failures, and rate-limiting API access.

    - key: "Horizontal Escalation"
      value: "Accessing resources belonging to other users at the same privilege level by manipulating identifiers or parameters"
    - key: "Vertical Escalation"
      value: "Gaining higher privilege functions such as administrative capabilities from a normal user account"
    - key: "Deny by Default"
      value: "Access control design principle where all access is denied unless explicitly granted through validated authorization rules"

  embedding_text: >-
    Access Control Vulnerability encompasses broken access control flaws where applications
    fail to enforce proper authorization restrictions. Ranked OWASP Top 10 A01:2021, this
    vulnerability class includes horizontal privilege escalation to access other users data,
    vertical escalation to gain administrative functions, missing function-level access
    controls, and insecure direct object references. Attackers manipulate URLs, API requests,
    JWT tokens, or session metadata to bypass authorization. Mitigation requires server-side
    enforcement, deny-by-default design, record ownership validation, access control failure
    logging, and API rate limiting. Impacts include data breaches, unauthorized data
    modification, and complete system compromise.
