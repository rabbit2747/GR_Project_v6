# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2002-20001 describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
    protocol where an attacker can send large DH exponents to force expensive modular exponentiation
    computations on the server. The vulnerability affects any implementation using Diffie-Hellman
    key exchange including TLS, SSH, and IKE/IPsec. Known as the D(HE)ater attack, it was formally
    cataloged in 2002 but received renewed attention as a practical DoS vector. CVSS score is 7.5.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant because Diffie-Hellman key exchange is fundamental to secure
    communications across TLS, SSH, and VPN protocols. The asymmetric computational cost allows a
    low-resource attacker to exhaust server CPU resources, causing denial of service for legitimate
    users. The attack is particularly impactful because it targets the handshake phase before any
    authentication occurs.
  how: >-
    The attacker initiates multiple TLS or IKE handshakes and sends carefully crafted large
    Diffie-Hellman public values that force the server to perform computationally expensive modular
    exponentiation operations. Since the server must compute the shared secret for each handshake
    attempt, and the attacker can generate requests far cheaper than the server can process them,
    this creates an asymmetric resource consumption that leads to CPU exhaustion and denial of
    service.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Asymmetric Resource Consumption"
      value: "Exploiting the computational cost difference between generating DH requests and processing them to exhaust server resources"
    - name: "Pre-Authentication Attack"
      value: "Targeting the key exchange phase that occurs before client authentication, allowing unauthenticated denial of service"
    - name: "Modular Exponentiation Cost"
      value: "Large DH exponents force expensive mathematical operations that consume disproportionate CPU time on the server"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2002-20001 describes the D(HE)ater attack, a denial-of-service vulnerability in the
    Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement protocol. An attacker can send large DH exponents to force
    expensive modular exponentiation computations on the server, causing CPU exhaustion. The
    vulnerability affects TLS, SSH, IKE/IPsec and any implementation using Diffie-Hellman key
    exchange. The attack exploits asymmetric computational costs where generating malicious
    requests is far cheaper than processing them on the server side. Since the attack targets
    the pre-authentication handshake phase, no credentials are required. Mitigation strategies
    include rate limiting handshake attempts, using ECDHE instead of DHE for key exchange,
    setting maximum DH parameter sizes, and implementing handshake timeouts. The vulnerability
    has a CVSS score of 7.5 and remains relevant for servers that support DHE cipher suites
    without proper resource management controls.
