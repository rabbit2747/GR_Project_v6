# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Cryptographic vulnerabilities represent a broad class of security weaknesses arising from
    flawed design, implementation, or configuration of cryptographic systems. This encompasses
    weak algorithms, insufficient key lengths, improper random number generation, side-channel
    leakage, protocol design flaws, and implementation errors in cryptographic libraries. These
    vulnerabilities can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity guarantees
    that cryptographic systems are designed to provide.
  why: >-
    Cryptography is the foundational trust mechanism for digital security, protecting data in
    transit and at rest, authenticating identities, and ensuring message integrity. Weaknesses
    in cryptographic implementations undermine the entire security model of systems that depend
    on them. A single cryptographic flaw can render all higher-level security controls ineffective,
    making this vulnerability class one of the most impactful in cybersecurity.
  how: >-
    Cryptographic vulnerabilities are exploited through various vectors depending on the specific
    weakness: mathematical attacks against weak algorithms (e.g., factoring RSA keys with
    insufficient length), side-channel attacks that extract key material through timing, power, or
    electromagnetic analysis, padding oracle attacks that decrypt ciphertext through error message
    analysis, protocol downgrade attacks that force use of weaker cipher suites, and implementation
    bugs that leak secrets through memory errors or improper state management.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Algorithm Weakness"
      value: "Fundamental mathematical or design flaws in cryptographic algorithms that reduce their effective security below intended levels"
    - name: "Implementation Error"
      value: "Programming mistakes in cryptographic code that introduce vulnerabilities absent from the theoretical algorithm design"
    - name: "Side-Channel Attack"
      value: "Exploiting observable physical characteristics of cryptographic operations to extract secret information without breaking the algorithm mathematically"

  embedding_text: >-
    Cryptographic vulnerabilities are a broad class of security weaknesses stemming from flawed
    design, implementation, or configuration of cryptographic systems. They encompass weak
    algorithms, insufficient key lengths, improper random number generation, side-channel leakage,
    protocol design flaws, and implementation errors in cryptographic libraries. These
    vulnerabilities undermine confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity guarantees. Exploitation
    vectors include mathematical attacks against weak algorithms, side-channel attacks extracting
    key material through timing or power analysis, padding oracle attacks, protocol downgrade
    attacks forcing weaker cipher suites, and implementation bugs leaking secrets through memory
    errors. Cryptography serves as the foundational trust mechanism for digital security, so
    weaknesses in this area can render all higher-level security controls ineffective. Common
    examples include Heartbleed, POODLE, BEAST, BREACH, FREAK, Logjam, and numerous other
    named vulnerabilities that have impacted TLS, SSH, and other cryptographic protocols.
