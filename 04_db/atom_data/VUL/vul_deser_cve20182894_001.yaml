# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2018-2894 is a critical vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server that allows unauthenticated
    remote code execution through unrestricted file upload via the Web Services test page. The
    vulnerability exists in the WLS-WSAT component where the test page allows uploading arbitrary
    files including JSP web shells to accessible server directories. CVSS score is 9.8. Affects
    WebLogic Server versions 12.1.3.0, 12.2.1.2, and 12.2.1.3.
  why: >-
    WebLogic Server is one of the most widely deployed Java EE application servers in enterprise
    environments. This vulnerability provides trivial unauthenticated RCE through a simple file
    upload, requiring no deserialization gadget chains or complex exploitation. The test page being
    enabled by default in some configurations made many production servers immediately exploitable.
  how: >-
    The attacker accesses the WLS-WSAT test page (typically at /ws_utc/config.do) which is accessible
    without authentication. Through this interface, the attacker uploads a JSP web shell to the
    server's web-accessible directory. The uploaded file can then be accessed directly via HTTP,
    executing arbitrary commands on the server. The vulnerability combines unrestricted file upload
    with predictable upload locations and web-accessible storage directories.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Unrestricted File Upload"
      value: "The WLS-WSAT test page allows uploading arbitrary file types including executable JSP files without authentication"
    - name: "Web Shell Deployment"
      value: "Uploaded JSP files are stored in web-accessible directories, enabling direct execution through HTTP requests"
    - name: "Test Interface Exposure"
      value: "Development and testing interfaces left enabled in production provide unauthenticated access to dangerous functionality"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2018-2894 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server
    caused by unrestricted file upload through the WLS-WSAT Web Services test page. The test
    page at /ws_utc/config.do is accessible without authentication and allows uploading arbitrary
    files including JSP web shells to web-accessible server directories. An attacker simply
    uploads a web shell and accesses it via HTTP to execute arbitrary commands. CVSS score is
    9.8, affecting WebLogic Server versions 12.1.3.0, 12.2.1.2, and 12.2.1.3. The vulnerability
    requires no deserialization gadget chains or complex exploitation, making it trivially
    exploitable. Mitigation involves disabling the WLS-WSAT test page in production environments,
    restricting access to management interfaces, and applying Oracle's Critical Patch Update.
    This is one of many critical vulnerabilities in WebLogic Server that have been actively
    exploited in the wild.
