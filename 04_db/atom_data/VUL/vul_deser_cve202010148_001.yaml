# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-10148 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion API
    that allows unauthenticated remote code execution. The vulnerability exists because the Orion
    API authentication can be bypassed by including specific parameters in the URI path, allowing
    unauthenticated access to API commands that can execute arbitrary code. CVSS score is 9.8.
    Disclosed during the SUNBURST supply chain attack investigation in December 2020. Affects
    SolarWinds Orion Platform versions 2019.4 HF5, 2020.2 with no hotfix, and 2020.2 HF1.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant in the context of the SUNBURST supply chain attack, one of
    the most sophisticated cyber espionage operations discovered. While SUNBURST was a supply
    chain backdoor, CVE-2020-10148 provided an additional exploitation path into SolarWinds Orion
    installations. SolarWinds Orion is used by thousands of organizations including government
    agencies for network monitoring, making it a high-value target.
  how: >-
    The attacker crafts HTTP requests to the SolarWinds Orion API with specific URI path
    manipulations that bypass the authentication mechanism. By appending certain path segments
    to API endpoints, the authentication check is circumvented, granting unauthenticated access
    to privileged API functions. Through these API functions, the attacker can execute arbitrary
    code on the Orion server, install additional malware, and pivot to monitored network devices.

    - name: "API Authentication Bypass"
      value: "URI path manipulation circumvents API authentication checks, granting unauthenticated access to privileged operations"
    - name: "Network Monitoring Platform Compromise"
      value: "Compromising SolarWinds Orion provides visibility into the entire monitored network infrastructure"
    - name: "Supply Chain Attack Context"
      value: "Discovered during the SUNBURST investigation, providing alternative exploitation paths into SolarWinds deployments"
