definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-49706 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Fortinet FortiManager, the
    centralized management platform for FortiGate firewalls and other Fortinet security devices. The
    vulnerability exists in the FortiManager FGFM (FortiGate-to-FortiManager) protocol handler,
    allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code or commands on the FortiManager
    server through specially crafted requests. CVSS v3: 9.8 (Critical).
  why: >-
    FortiManager is the central management console that controls the configuration and monitoring of
    all FortiGate firewalls in an organization's deployment. Compromising FortiManager provides
    attackers with the ability to push malicious configurations to all managed FortiGate devices,
    extract stored credentials and certificates, access network topology information, and disable
    security controls across the entire Fortinet deployment. This is a force-multiplier vulnerability
    where a single compromise cascades to all managed security devices. This follows the pattern of
    CVE-2024-47575 (FortiJump), another critical FortiManager vulnerability exploited in the wild.
  how: >-
    The attacker sends specially crafted requests to the FortiManager FGFM protocol service, which
    listens for connections from managed FortiGate devices. The crafted requests exploit insufficient
    validation in the FGFM protocol handler, allowing injection of arbitrary commands that execute in
    the context of the FortiManager process. No valid FortiGate serial number or authentication is
    required. Post-exploitation enables configuration extraction from all managed FortiGate devices,
    credential harvesting, and pushing malicious firewall policies. Fortinet released emergency
    patches and recommended restricting FGFM service access to known FortiGate IP addresses.

    CVE-2025-49706 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Fortinet FortiManager's FGFM
    protocol handler allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the management
    server. CVSS v3 score is 9.8 Critical. FortiManager is the centralized management platform for
    all FortiGate firewalls in an organization. Compromising FortiManager enables pushing malicious

    Exploitation requires no authentication. Mitigation includes restricting FGFM service access and
    applying emergency patches. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application.
