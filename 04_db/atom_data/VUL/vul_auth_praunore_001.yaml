# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Pre-Auth Not Required is a vulnerability class where systems, services, or endpoints can be
    accessed and exploited without providing any authentication credentials. This encompasses
    authentication bypass vulnerabilities, exposed administrative interfaces without login
    requirements, API endpoints lacking authentication checks, services with default or missing
    authentication configurations, and design flaws that allow unauthenticated access to
    privileged functionality. Pre-authentication vulnerabilities are the most dangerous class
    of access control failures because they require no prior knowledge or access.
  why: >-
    Pre-authentication vulnerabilities represent the highest-risk class of access control failures
    because they allow any attacker with network connectivity to exploit the target without
    needing stolen credentials or prior access. These vulnerabilities are the most sought-after
    by both advanced persistent threat groups and commodity attackers, as they provide the simplest
    path from internet exposure to initial access. Many of the most impactful CVEs in recent years
    (ProxyLogon, Ivanti auth bypass, ScreenConnect) are pre-authentication vulnerabilities in
    network perimeter devices.
  how: >-
    Attackers exploit pre-authentication vulnerabilities by sending crafted requests to exposed
    services that bypass or circumvent authentication checks. Common techniques include path
    traversal to bypass authentication middleware, exploiting race conditions in authentication
    logic, accessing administrative setup wizards, exploiting SSRF to reach internal endpoints,
    and targeting default configurations that expose functionality without authentication.
    Mitigation includes implementing defense in depth with multiple authentication layers,
    enforcing authentication on all endpoints by default (deny-by-default), regular security
    auditing of access controls, deploying web application firewalls, limiting exposure of
    management interfaces, and implementing zero-trust network architecture.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Authentication Bypass"
      value: "Circumventing authentication controls to access protected resources without valid credentials, often through path traversal, SSRF, or logic flaws"
    - key: "Zero-Credential Attack Surface"
      value: "Functionality accessible without any authentication represents the highest-risk attack surface as it requires only network connectivity to exploit"
