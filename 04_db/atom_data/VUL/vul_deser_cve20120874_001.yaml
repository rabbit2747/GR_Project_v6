# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2012-0874 is a remote code execution vulnerability in JBoss Application Server where the
    EJBInvokerServlet and JMXInvokerServlet endpoints deserialize untrusted Java objects from HTTP
    requests without authentication or input validation. An attacker can send crafted serialized
    Java objects to these endpoints to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. CVSS score
    is 7.5. The vulnerability affects JBoss AS 4.x and 5.x and was one of the earliest widely
    exploited Java deserialization vulnerabilities.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is historically significant as one of the first major Java deserialization
    RCE vulnerabilities to be widely exploited in the wild. It demonstrated that exposing Java
    serialization endpoints without authentication creates a trivial path to remote code execution.
    JBoss AS was widely deployed in enterprise environments, making this a high-impact vulnerability
    that foreshadowed the broader Java deserialization vulnerability epidemic.
  how: >-
    The attacker sends an HTTP POST request containing a crafted serialized Java object to the
    EJBInvokerServlet or JMXInvokerServlet endpoint. These servlets deserialize the request body
    without authentication, allowing the attacker to trigger arbitrary method calls through gadget
    chains present in the server's classpath. Common exploitation uses the Apache Commons Collections
    gadget chain to execute operating system commands during deserialization.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Unauthenticated Deserialization Endpoint"
      value: "JBoss invoker servlets accept and deserialize arbitrary Java objects from any HTTP client without authentication"
    - name: "Gadget Chain Exploitation"
      value: "Crafted serialized objects leverage classes in the server's classpath to chain method calls leading to code execution"
    - name: "Enterprise Application Server Risk"
      value: "Default JBoss configurations exposed dangerous deserialization endpoints to the network"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2012-0874 is a remote code execution vulnerability in JBoss Application Server caused by
    insecure deserialization in the EJBInvokerServlet and JMXInvokerServlet endpoints. These
    servlets accept and deserialize Java objects from HTTP requests without authentication or
    validation, allowing attackers to send crafted serialized objects that trigger arbitrary code
    execution through gadget chains. The vulnerability affects JBoss AS 4.x and 5.x and was one
    of the earliest widely exploited Java deserialization vulnerabilities. Common exploitation
    leverages Apache Commons Collections gadget chains to execute operating system commands. The
    vulnerability demonstrated the danger of exposing Java serialization endpoints and
    foreshadowed the broader epidemic of deserialization vulnerabilities in Java enterprise
    application servers. CVSS score is 7.5. Mitigation involves removing or restricting access
    to invoker servlets and implementing serialization filtering.
