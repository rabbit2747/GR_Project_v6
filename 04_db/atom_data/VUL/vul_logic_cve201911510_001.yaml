# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2019-11510 is a pre-authentication arbitrary file read vulnerability in Pulse Connect
    Secure (Pulse Secure VPN) that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary
    files from the VPN server including cached plaintext credentials. The vulnerability exists
    in the URL handling logic of the web interface, where specially crafted URIs bypass
    authentication checks and path validation to access files outside the web root.
    CVSS v3 base score: 10.0 (Critical).
  why: >-
    Pulse Secure VPN appliances are widely deployed as remote access gateways in enterprise
    and government networks. Exploitation yields cached credentials for all VPN users,
    enabling mass compromise of organizational accounts. This vulnerability was extensively
    exploited by nation-state actors and ransomware groups, with CISA issuing multiple
    emergency directives. It was a primary vector in numerous high-profile breaches.
  how: >-
    An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with directory traversal sequences to
    the Pulse Secure web interface. The URL handling logic fails to properly validate paths
    before authentication, allowing unauthenticated access to arbitrary files including
    /data/runtime/mtmp/lmdb/dataa/data.mdb which contains cached plaintext user credentials.
    No authentication is required for exploitation.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Pre-Auth Path Traversal"
      value: "URL handling logic flaw allows unauthenticated directory traversal, bypassing both authentication and path restrictions simultaneously"
    - key: "Credential Cache Exposure"
      value: "VPN appliance stores cached plaintext credentials accessible through the file read vulnerability, enabling mass account compromise"
