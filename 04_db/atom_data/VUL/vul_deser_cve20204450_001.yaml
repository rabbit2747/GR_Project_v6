# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-4450 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in IBM WebSphere Application Server
    that allows unauthenticated remote code execution through the IIOP protocol. The vulnerability
    exploits a chain of deserialization gadgets in the WebSphere classpath to achieve full server
    compromise. CVSS score is 9.8. Affects IBM WebSphere Application Server versions 8.5 and 9.0.
    Discovered by ZDI researchers and disclosed in June 2020.
  why: >-
    IBM WebSphere is one of the major enterprise Java application servers alongside Oracle WebLogic.
    This vulnerability demonstrates that deserialization attacks are not limited to WebLogic but
    affect the entire Java application server ecosystem. The IIOP protocol vector means the
    vulnerability is exploitable even when HTTP-based protections are in place, and the unauthenticated
    nature makes it immediately exploitable on exposed instances.
  how: >-
    The attacker connects to the WebSphere IIOP listener and sends a crafted serialized Java object
    that exploits a multi-step gadget chain. The chain leverages classes from the WebSphere
    transaction service and javax.management package to achieve arbitrary method invocation. The
    deserialization triggers a sequence of object instantiations and method calls that ultimately
    allow the attacker to execute operating system commands or deploy arbitrary code on the server.

    - name: "Cross-Platform Deserialization"
      value: "Demonstrates that deserialization vulnerabilities affect all major Java application servers, not just WebLogic"
    - name: "IIOP Pre-Authentication RCE"
      value: "Unauthenticated code execution through IIOP protocol before any application-level security is applied"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2020-4450 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in IBM WebSphere Application Server
    enabling unauthenticated remote code execution through the IIOP protocol. The vulnerability
    exploits a multi-step gadget chain leveraging WebSphere transaction service and JMX classes
    to achieve arbitrary code execution. CVSS score is 9.8, affecting WebSphere versions 8.5 and
    9.0. The IIOP vector bypasses HTTP-focused security controls. This vulnerability demonstrates
    that deserialization attacks affect all major Java application servers, not just Oracle
    WebLogic. IBM WebSphere is widely deployed in enterprise environments for mission-critical
    applications. Discovered by ZDI researchers, the vulnerability requires no authentication and
    can be exploited over the network. Mitigation includes applying IBM security patches,
    disabling IIOP if not required, implementing network segmentation, and using Java
    serialization filters to restrict deserializable classes.
