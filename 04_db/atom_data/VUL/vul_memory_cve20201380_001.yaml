# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-1380 is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 7.5) in the Internet Explorer
    JScript9 scripting engine that allows remote code execution when processing malicious
    web content. Discovered by Kaspersky as an active zero-day in August 2020, it was
    exploited by the DarkHotel APT group in targeted attacks through compromised websites
    and malicious Office documents embedding IE content. The vulnerability affects Internet
    Explorer 11 across all supported Windows versions. Microsoft patched it in August 2020
    as part of the monthly security update.
  why: >-
    CVE-2020-1380 continued the pattern of IE scripting engine exploitation even as
    organizations migrated to modern browsers. The vulnerability was significant because
    IE's rendering engine can be invoked by Office documents and other applications, meaning
    users who never directly open Internet Explorer can still be affected. Its exploitation
    by DarkHotel demonstrated persistent interest in IE exploits for targeted espionage.
  how: >-
    The exploit creates a use-after-free condition in jscript9.dll by manipulating JavaScript
    object properties and JIT-compiled code execution. When malicious content is rendered by
    IE (directly or through embedded content in Office), the scripting engine processes
    crafted JavaScript that causes a type confusion during JIT compilation. The freed memory
    is reallocated with attacker-controlled data enabling arbitrary read/write and eventually
    code execution. Delivery occurs through watering hole attacks or Office documents that
    invoke IE rendering.

      value: "IE rendering engine invokable through Office and other applications affecting users who never directly use IE"

      value: "Exploited by DarkHotel APT in targeted watering hole and Office-based spear-phishing attacks"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2020-1380 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer's JScript9
    scripting engine with CVSS 7.5 enabling remote code execution through malicious web
    content. Discovered by Kaspersky as an active zero-day in August 2020, it was exploited
    by DarkHotel APT through watering hole attacks and Office documents. The flaw creates
    a type confusion during JIT compilation in jscript9.dll, enabling arbitrary read/write
    primitives. IE's rendering engine can be invoked indirectly through Office and other
    applications, affecting users who never directly use Internet Explorer. Patched in
    August 2020 as part of Microsoft's monthly security update.
