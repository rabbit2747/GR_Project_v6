# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2016-3088 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ versions before
    5.14.0 that allows attackers to upload and execute arbitrary files through the Fileserver
    web application. The ActiveMQ Fileserver allows HTTP PUT method file uploads without
    proper authentication or file type restrictions, enabling attackers to upload JSP web
    shells or other executable content. The CVSS v3 base score is 9.8 (Critical) and it
    was disclosed in June 2016.
  why: >-
    Apache ActiveMQ is one of the most popular open-source message brokers used in enterprise
    messaging architectures. The ability to upload arbitrary files to a web server without
    authentication provides a trivial path to remote code execution. Many ActiveMQ deployments
    expose the web console to the network, making this vulnerability easily discoverable and
    exploitable in mass scanning campaigns.
  how: >-
    Attackers use HTTP PUT requests to upload a JSP web shell to the ActiveMQ Fileserver
    endpoint. Since the Fileserver does not require authentication and does not restrict file
    types, the web shell is stored on the server. The attacker then accesses the uploaded JSP
    file through the web server to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system. Some
    exploit variants use the MOVE method to relocate uploaded files to web-accessible
    directories. Mitigation requires upgrading ActiveMQ, disabling the Fileserver application,
    and restricting web console access.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Unrestricted File Upload"
      value: "HTTP PUT method allows uploading arbitrary files including web shells without authentication or type validation"
    - key: "Web Shell Deployment"
      value: "Uploaded JSP files execute server-side code when accessed through the web server, providing command execution"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2016-3088 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ
    before 5.14.0 with CVSS score 9.8. The Fileserver web application allows unauthenticated
    HTTP PUT file uploads without file type restrictions, enabling attackers to deploy JSP
    web shells for arbitrary command execution. Apache ActiveMQ is a widely deployed
    open-source message broker in enterprise architectures. Exploitation is trivial through
    PUT requests to upload web shells followed by HTTP access to execute commands. Some
    variants use the MOVE method to relocate files to web-accessible paths. Mitigation
    requires upgrading ActiveMQ, disabling the Fileserver application, and restricting
    web console network access.
