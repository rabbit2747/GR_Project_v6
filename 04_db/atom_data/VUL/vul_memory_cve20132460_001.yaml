# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2013-2460 is a sandbox bypass vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 21
    and earlier versions. The flaw exists in the Java Management Extensions (JMX) implementation,
    specifically in the ProviderSkeleton invoke method handling. It allows untrusted Java applets
    to escape the security sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the target system. Patched in
    the June 2013 Critical Patch Update, this vulnerability was exploited in the wild and
    integrated into exploit kits.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability continued the pattern of critical Java sandbox bypasses that plagued the
    platform throughout 2012-2013. With CVSS 10.0, it provided another reliable entry point for
    exploit kit authors. The JMX component was a recurring source of Java security issues, and
    this vulnerability reinforced the growing consensus that Java browser plugins were
    fundamentally insecure and should be disabled by default.
  how: >-
    The exploit leverages a flaw in the JMX ProviderSkeleton invoke method to gain access to
    restricted Java API calls. By chaining this with reflection-based techniques, the attacker
    escalates privileges within the Java runtime to disable the security manager. Once the
    sandbox is bypassed, the untrusted applet can execute arbitrary operating system commands
    with the privileges of the user running the browser.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2013-2460 is a critical Java sandbox bypass vulnerability with CVSS 10.0 in Oracle
    Java SE 7 Update 21 and earlier. The flaw exploits the JMX ProviderSkeleton invoke method
    to gain access to restricted Java APIs, enabling privilege escalation to disable the
    security manager. Untrusted applets can then execute arbitrary system commands with user
    privileges. Patched in the June 2013 Critical Patch Update, this vulnerability was
    exploited in the wild and integrated into exploit kits. It continued the series of
    critical Java sandbox bypasses that demonstrated fundamental weaknesses in the Java
    browser plugin security model during 2012-2013.
