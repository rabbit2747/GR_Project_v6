# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2022-40735 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman key exchange
    implementations where an attacker can send excessively large DH parameters during the TLS
    handshake to force computationally expensive operations on the server. The vulnerability is
    similar to CVE-2002-20001 but applies to specific implementations that lack proper parameter
    size validation. CVSS score is 7.5. The vulnerability affects implementations that do not
    enforce maximum DH parameter sizes during key exchange negotiation.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability demonstrates that DH resource exhaustion attacks remain a persistent threat
    even decades after the initial DH protocol design. Modern servers that support DHE cipher suites
    without parameter size limits remain vulnerable to asymmetric denial-of-service attacks where
    the cost to the attacker is minimal compared to the computational burden on the server.
  how: >-
    The attacker initiates TLS handshakes with the target server and sends Diffie-Hellman public
    values with excessively large parameters. The server must perform modular exponentiation with
    these large values, consuming significant CPU resources. By initiating many concurrent
    handshakes with oversized parameters, the attacker can exhaust server CPU capacity and cause
    denial of service for legitimate clients. The attack is effective because DH exponentiation
    cost grows with parameter size and the server processes parameters before authentication.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Parameter Size Abuse"
      value: "Sending oversized DH parameters exploits the lack of maximum size validation to force expensive server-side computations"
    - name: "Asymmetric DoS"
      value: "Minimal attacker cost to generate large DH values versus significant server CPU cost to process them"
    - name: "Pre-Authentication Exhaustion"
      value: "The attack occurs during the TLS handshake before any client authentication, enabling unauthenticated resource exhaustion"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2022-40735 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman key exchange
    implementations where an attacker sends excessively large DH parameters during TLS handshakes
    to force computationally expensive modular exponentiation on the server. The vulnerability
    exploits the lack of maximum parameter size validation in affected implementations. By
    initiating many concurrent handshakes with oversized parameters, an attacker can exhaust
    server CPU resources at minimal cost to themselves. This is a persistent class of DH
    resource exhaustion vulnerability similar to CVE-2002-20001 that continues to affect
    implementations without proper parameter bounds checking. CVSS score is 7.5. Mitigations
    include enforcing maximum DH parameter sizes, preferring ECDHE over DHE, implementing rate
    limiting on handshakes, and using predefined DH groups per RFC 7919 rather than accepting
    arbitrary parameters from peers.
