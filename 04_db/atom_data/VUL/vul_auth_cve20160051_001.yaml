# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2016-0051 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows WebDAV client
    driver (mrxdav.sys). The vulnerability exists because the WebDAV client improperly
    validates input, allowing a locally authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with
    elevated privileges. By running a specially crafted application, an attacker can take
    complete control of an affected system. CVSS v3.0 score is 7.8.
  why: >-
    The WebDAV client is enabled by default on Windows workstations, providing a broadly
    applicable privilege escalation vector. This vulnerability is particularly useful in
    post-exploitation scenarios where an attacker has limited user access and needs to
    escalate to SYSTEM. The WebDAV service's kernel-mode driver provides direct access to
    elevated privileges when exploited.
  how: >-
    A local attacker runs a crafted application that sends specially formatted requests to
    the mrxdav.sys driver. The driver's improper input validation allows memory corruption
    that can be leveraged for kernel-mode code execution. Mitigation requires applying
    MS16-016, and where WebDAV functionality is not needed, disabling the WebClient service
    to reduce the attack surface.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2016-0051 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows WebDAV client
    driver mrxdav.sys with CVSS v3.0 score 7.8. Improper input validation allows a local
    attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges through a crafted application.
    The WebDAV client is enabled by default on Windows workstations, making this a broadly
    applicable escalation vector. Affects Windows Vista through 10 and Server 2008 through
    2012 R2. Mitigation requires applying MS16-016 or disabling the WebClient service where
    WebDAV is not needed. Commonly used in post-exploitation scenarios for privilege escalation
    from limited user access to full system control.
