# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2014-9195 is a vulnerability in Siemens SIMATIC WinCC and PCS 7 SCADA systems involving
    multiple security issues including hardcoded credentials and insufficient access control
    logic. The system contains default credentials that are not required to be changed during
    installation, and certain web server components lack proper authentication enforcement.
    This allows remote attackers to gain unauthorized access to the SCADA management interface.
    CVSS v2 base score: 7.5 (High).
  why: >-
    SIMATIC WinCC is widely deployed in critical infrastructure including power plants, water
    treatment facilities, and manufacturing. Unauthorized access to SCADA systems can lead to
    manipulation of industrial processes, equipment damage, safety hazards, and disruption of
    essential services. The Stuxnet worm previously targeted WinCC systems, demonstrating the
    real-world consequences of ICS security failures.
  how: >-
    An attacker uses default or hardcoded credentials to authenticate to the WinCC web server
    or database interfaces. The system's authentication logic fails to enforce credential
    changes during initial setup and does not adequately restrict access to sensitive management
    functions. Network-accessible interfaces allow remote exploitation without physical access
    to the ICS environment.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "ICS Authentication Logic Failure"
      value: "Default credentials and missing forced-change logic in SCADA systems allow unauthorized remote access to critical infrastructure controls"
    - key: "Critical Infrastructure Exposure"
      value: "Insufficient access control in industrial control systems creates risk of physical process manipulation and safety incidents"
