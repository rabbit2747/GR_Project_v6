# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2022-0609 is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 8.8) in Google Chrome's Animation
    component that allows remote code execution through crafted web pages. Disclosed in
    February 2022 as an actively exploited zero-day, it was exploited by North Korean
    (Lazarus Group) threat actors in Operation Dream Job and Operation AppleJeus campaigns
    targeting cryptocurrency, media, and technology organizations. The vulnerability was
    Chrome's first zero-day of 2022 and was patched via emergency update. Google TAG
    identified two distinct Lazarus subgroups using the same exploit kit.
  why: >-
    CVE-2022-0609 demonstrated the continued capability of North Korean threat actors in
    browser exploitation, with the same exploit being shared between multiple Lazarus
    subgroups running different campaigns (cryptocurrency theft and espionage). The
    targeting of cryptocurrency organizations aligned with DPRK's use of cybercrime for
    revenue generation. Its exploitation through both watering hole attacks and direct
    spear-phishing showed operational sophistication. Chrome's market dominance meant
    the vulnerability had massive potential impact.
  how: >-
    The exploit serves crafted JavaScript through compromised websites (watering holes) or
    attacker-controlled domains that triggers a use-after-free in Chrome's Animation
    component. The freed memory is reclaimed with attacker-controlled content to achieve
    arbitrary code execution within the Chrome renderer process. The exploit kit included
    a sandbox escape component to break out of Chrome's security sandbox for full system
    compromise. Delivery involved fake job offers (Dream Job) and fake cryptocurrency
    trading platforms (AppleJeus) targeting specific industries.

    CVE-2022-0609 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome's Animation component
    with CVSS 8.8 enabling remote code execution through crafted web pages. Chrome's first
    zero-day of 2022, it was exploited by Lazarus Group in Operation Dream Job (espionage)
    and Operation AppleJeus (cryptocurrency theft). The same exploit kit was shared between
    multiple DPRK subgroups, including a sandbox escape for full system compromise. Delivery
    used fake job offers and cryptocurrency trading platforms targeting specific industries.
    Patched via emergency Chrome update in February 2022, demonstrating continued North
    Korean capability in browser exploitation.
