# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Password Not Required is a vulnerability class where user accounts, service accounts, or system
    accounts are configured to allow authentication without providing a password. This includes
    accounts with the PASSWD_NOTREQD flag set in Active Directory, database accounts with empty
    passwords, application accounts configured without password requirements, and systems that
    accept blank password submissions. This misconfiguration effectively removes the primary
    authentication barrier, allowing anyone who knows the username to access the account.
  why: >-
    Accounts without password requirements represent one of the most fundamental authentication
    failures. They are frequently discovered during penetration testing and security audits of
    enterprise environments, particularly in Active Directory where the PASSWD_NOTREQD flag can
    persist on legacy accounts. Service accounts, shared accounts, and accounts created for
    automated processes are commonly affected. Attackers actively search for passwordless accounts
    during network enumeration as they provide the easiest path to initial access or privilege
    escalation.
  how: >-
    Attackers discover password-not-required accounts through Active Directory enumeration (using
    tools like PowerView or ldapsearch to query UserAccountControl flags), database enumeration
    of accounts with empty passwords, or brute-force testing with empty password fields.
    Mitigation includes auditing all accounts for the PASSWD_NOTREQD flag in Active Directory,
    enforcing password requirements through Group Policy, implementing password policies that
    reject empty passwords at the application level, regularly scanning for accounts without
    passwords, and using privileged access management (PAM) solutions for service accounts.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "PASSWD_NOTREQD Flag"
      value: "Active Directory User Account Control flag that allows an account to have an empty password, bypassing domain password policy requirements"
    - key: "Authentication Barrier Removal"
      value: "Eliminating the password requirement removes the primary knowledge-based authentication factor, reducing security to username knowledge alone"

    Password Not Required is a vulnerability class where accounts are configured to allow
    authentication without a password. This includes Active Directory accounts with the
    PASSWD_NOTREQD UserAccountControl flag, database accounts with empty passwords, and
    application accounts without password requirements. Attackers discover these through AD
    enumeration, database scanning, or brute-force testing with empty credentials. Commonly
    found on legacy accounts, service accounts, and automated process accounts. Represents a
    fundamental authentication failure that reduces security to username knowledge alone.
    Mitigation includes auditing for PASSWD_NOTREQD flags, enforcing password policies via
    Group Policy, application-level password requirements, regular scanning, and privileged
    access management for service accounts.
