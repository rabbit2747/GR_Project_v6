# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2022-21449 (Psychic Signatures) is a critical vulnerability in Oracle Java's ECDSA
    (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) implementation where a blank or zero-value
    signature (r=0, s=0) is accepted as valid for any message and any public key. The vulnerability
    exists in Java versions 15 through 18 due to a rewrite of the EC code in Java 15 that omitted
    a check for zero values in signature components. CVSS score is 7.5. Disclosed in April 2022.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is exceptionally severe because ECDSA signatures are used for JWT
    authentication tokens, TLS certificate validation, code signing (JAR files), and many other
    security-critical operations in the Java ecosystem. An attacker can forge a valid signature
    for any data by simply providing (0,0) as the signature, completely bypassing signature-based
    authentication and integrity checks across all Java applications on affected versions.
  how: >-
    The attacker creates an ECDSA signature with both components (r, s) set to zero. In correct
    ECDSA implementations, r and s must be checked to be non-zero and within the valid range.
    The Java 15+ implementation, rewritten in Java from the original C code, omitted this
    validation. When the verification algorithm receives (0, 0), it computes values that
    mathematically result in accepting the signature as valid for any message and any public key.
    The attacker can forge JWTs, bypass TLS client certificate authentication, sign arbitrary
    JAR files, and forge any ECDSA-signed data.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Zero-Value Signature Acceptance"
      value: "The ECDSA implementation accepts (r=0, s=0) as a valid signature for any message due to missing range validation"
    - name: "Universal Signature Forgery"
      value: "A single blank signature value works against any public key and any message, enabling trivial forgery"
    - name: "Implementation Regression"
      value: "Rewriting cryptographic code in Java 15 introduced the bug by omitting validation present in the original C implementation"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2022-21449, dubbed Psychic Signatures, is a critical vulnerability in Oracle Java's ECDSA
    implementation where a blank signature with r=0 and s=0 is accepted as valid for any message
    and any public key. The bug was introduced in Java 15 when the EC signature code was rewritten
    from C to Java, omitting the check that r and s must be non-zero. This allows trivial forgery
    of any ECDSA-signed data including JWT authentication tokens, TLS client certificates, JAR
    code signatures, and SAML assertions. An attacker simply provides a zero-value signature to
    bypass all ECDSA-based authentication and integrity verification. CVSS score is 7.5, affecting
    Java SE versions 15 through 18. The vulnerability is exceptionally easy to exploit as no
    computation is needed to produce the forged signature. Oracle patched the issue in the April
    2022 Critical Patch Update by adding proper range validation for ECDSA signature components.
