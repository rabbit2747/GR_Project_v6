# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-14882 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server that
    allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code through the WebLogic Admin Console.
    The vulnerability bypasses console authentication through a path traversal in the URL, reaching
    backend functionality that can be leveraged for code execution. CVSS score is 9.8. Disclosed
    in the October 2020 Oracle Critical Patch Update and immediately exploited in the wild.
  why: >-
    WebLogic Server is one of the most widely deployed Java EE application servers in enterprise
    environments. CVE-2020-14882 was trivially exploitable with a single HTTP GET request, making
    it one of the most dangerous WebLogic vulnerabilities. Mass exploitation began within hours of
    public proof-of-concept release, affecting thousands of internet-facing WebLogic servers.
  how: >-
    The attacker sends an HTTP request to the WebLogic Admin Console with a specially crafted URL
    containing path traversal sequences that bypass the authentication filter. The URL reaches
    internal console handler classes that can be used to invoke arbitrary code. Specifically, the
    attacker accesses the console.portal resource with a crafted handle parameter that triggers
    server-side code execution through the FileSystemXmlApplicationContext or similar mechanisms.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Console Authentication Bypass"
      value: "Path traversal in the URL bypasses the WebLogic Admin Console's authentication filter"
    - name: "Trivial Exploitation"
      value: "Remote code execution achievable with a single HTTP GET request without any authentication"
    - name: "Mass Exploitation"
      value: "Proof-of-concept release led to immediate mass exploitation of internet-facing WebLogic servers"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2020-14882 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server
    allowing unauthenticated RCE through the Admin Console. A path traversal in the URL bypasses
    the authentication filter, enabling attackers to reach internal console handler classes for
    code execution with a single HTTP GET request. CVSS score is 9.8, affecting WebLogic Server
    versions 10.3.6.0 through 14.1.1.0. Mass exploitation began within hours of proof-of-concept
    release. The vulnerability was patched in Oracle's October 2020 Critical Patch Update but the
    patch was bypassed by CVE-2020-14750 within days. WebLogic Server is widely deployed in
    enterprise environments, making this one of the most impactful application server
    vulnerabilities. Listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. Mitigation
    includes applying patches, restricting admin console access, and implementing WAF rules.
