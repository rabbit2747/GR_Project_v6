definition:
  what: "CVE-2023-20867 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in VMware Tools that allows a fully compromised ESXi host to force VMware Tools to fail to authenticate host-to-guest operations. This enables an attacker who has compromised the ESXi hypervisor to execute privileged commands within guest VMs without proper authentication, bypassing the guest VM's security controls."
  why: "This vulnerability was actively exploited by UNC3886, a Chinese state-sponsored espionage group, as part of a sophisticated attack chain targeting VMware infrastructure in defense, government, and technology organizations. The vulnerability is critical because it breaks the security boundary between hypervisor and guest VMs, allowing hypervisor-level access to translate directly into guest VM compromise. This undermines the fundamental security assumption that guest VMs are isolated from each other and from the hypervisor."
  how: "After compromising an ESXi host (using other vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-22948 or CVE-2023-34048), the attacker uses CVE-2023-20867 to execute guest operations through VMware Tools without authentication. The attacker can transfer files to/from guest VMs, execute commands within VMs, and access guest VM data without any authentication prompts or logs within the guest OS. UNC3886 used this to deploy VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE malware families in guest VMs. VMware addressed this in VMware Tools 12.2.5. CVSS v3: 3.9 (Low, but contextually critical)."
