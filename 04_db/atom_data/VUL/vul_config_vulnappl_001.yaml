definition:
  what: >-
    Vulnerable Application is a vulnerability class encompassing applications deployed with security
    weaknesses that expose them to exploitation. This includes applications with known CVEs in their
    frameworks or libraries, insecure default configurations, missing security headers, exposed debug
    endpoints, hardcoded credentials, excessive permissions, and insufficient input validation. The
    class covers both custom-developed applications and third-party software deployed without proper
    security hardening.
  why: >-
    Applications are the primary attack surface for most organizations, processing user input and
    managing sensitive data. Vulnerable applications provide direct entry points for attackers to
    access internal systems, exfiltrate data, and establish persistence. The OWASP Top 10 documents
    the most critical application security risks, with misconfiguration consistently ranked among the
    top threats. The proliferation of microservices, APIs, and cloud-native applications has expanded
    the application attack surface significantly. Many breaches originate from exploiting known
    vulnerabilities in applications that have not been patched or properly configured.
  how: >-
    Attackers identify vulnerable applications through automated scanning, version fingerprinting,
    and reconnaissance. Common exploitation vectors include: exploiting known CVEs in application
    frameworks (Spring, Django, Express, Rails); accessing exposed administrative interfaces and
    debug endpoints; leveraging default credentials that were not changed during deployment;
    exploiting missing authentication on API endpoints; abusing insecure deserialization and
    injection flaws; and chaining multiple lower-severity vulnerabilities for higher impact.
    Mitigation requires regular vulnerability scanning, patch management, secure configuration
    baselines, application security testing (SAST/DAST), and continuous monitoring.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Application Attack Surface"
      value: "Applications are the primary external attack surface, processing untrusted input and managing access to sensitive data and internal systems"
    - key: "Configuration Security Debt"
      value: "Applications deployed with default or insecure configurations accumulate security debt that increases exploitation risk over time"
    - key: "Patch Management Gap"
      value: "The time between vulnerability disclosure and patch application creates a window of exposure that attackers actively exploit"
