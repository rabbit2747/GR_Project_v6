# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2011-0611 (CVSS 9.3) is a critical use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player
    10.2.153.1 and earlier triggered by processing malicious SWF content. The vulnerability
    allows arbitrary code execution when Flash Player incorrectly handles object references
    during SWF content processing. Exploited as a zero-day in widespread targeted attacks
    via malicious Flash content embedded in Word documents and web pages. Patched in APSB11-07
    (April 2011).
  why: >-
    This zero-day was one of the most actively exploited Flash vulnerabilities, used in multiple
    simultaneous attack campaigns by different threat actors. The RSA Security breach, which
    compromised SecurID token seeds affecting numerous government and defense organizations,
    reportedly used this exploit. The incident demonstrated how a single vulnerability in
    ubiquitous software could have cascading security impacts across an entire industry.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability is triggered when Flash Player processes SWF content containing specific
    ActionScript that causes an object to be freed while still referenced. The use-after-free
    allows attacker-controlled data to be written to the freed memory location. Primary attack
    vector used Flash content embedded in Microsoft Word documents delivered via spearphishing,
    as well as drive-by download attacks through compromised websites. Heap spraying places
    shellcode at predictable addresses for reliable exploitation upon triggering the freed
    object access.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Flash Use-After-Free"
      value: "ActionScript processing causes object reference to persist after memory is freed, enabling controlled memory corruption"
    - key: "RSA Breach Vector"
      value: "Reportedly used in the RSA Security breach that compromised SecurID seeds, with cascading impact across government and defense"
    - key: "Multi-Vector Delivery"
      value: "Simultaneously exploited via Word document embedding and web-based drive-by download attacks"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2011-0611 is a critical use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Adobe Flash Player
    10.2 and earlier (APSB11-07). Malicious SWF ActionScript triggers incorrect object reference
    handling causing freed memory access and arbitrary code execution. Exploited as a zero-day
    in the RSA Security breach that compromised SecurID token seeds, impacting government and
    defense organizations. Delivered via Flash embedded in Word documents and drive-by web
    attacks. One of the most impactful Flash vulnerabilities in cybersecurity history.
