# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-32463 is a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVSS 7.8) in the sudo
    utility that allows a local attacker to gain root privileges by exploiting a flaw in
    sudo's handling of TLS certificate verification when configured with sudo_logsrvd.
    When sudo is compiled with TLS support and configured to send logs to a remote log
    server, a local user can manipulate the TLS verification process to bypass sudo
    policy restrictions and execute commands as root. The vulnerability was disclosed
    and patched in sudo version 1.9.17p1 in 2025. Since sudo is installed on virtually
    every Unix-like system, the vulnerability has broad potential impact.
  why: >-
    sudo is one of the most security-critical utilities on Unix systems, mediating all
    privileged operations. Any vulnerability that bypasses sudo's policy enforcement
    effectively breaks the fundamental privilege boundary on Unix-like systems.
    CVE-2025-32463 is notable because it targets the TLS integration feature used for
    centralized logging, a security-enhancing configuration that paradoxically introduced
    a privilege escalation vector. The vulnerability highlights how security features
    themselves can expand the attack surface.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability exploits a flaw in how sudo handles TLS certificate verification
    when communicating with sudo_logsrvd. By manipulating the TLS handshake or
    certificate chain validation, a local attacker can cause sudo to process commands
    in a context that bypasses normal policy checks. The TLS verification code path
    contains a logic error where failure to properly validate certificates can lead to
    sudo executing the requested command with elevated privileges regardless of the
    configured sudoers policy. This effectively allows any local user to execute
    arbitrary commands as root.

    CVE-2025-32463 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in sudo with CVSS 7.8,
    exploiting a TLS certificate verification flaw when sudo communicates with
    sudo_logsrvd for centralized logging. The logic error in TLS handling allows local
    attackers to bypass sudoers policy enforcement and execute commands as root. Since
    sudo is installed on virtually every Unix system, the vulnerability has broad impact.
    The flaw highlights how security-enhancing features like TLS logging can paradoxically
    introduce new attack surfaces. Patched in sudo 1.9.17p1 in 2025.
