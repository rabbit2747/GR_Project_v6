# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Security Vulnerability in the information disclosure context is a broad vulnerability class
    (CWE-200) where a system or application unintentionally exposes sensitive information to
    actors not authorized to access it. This encompasses exposure of system internals, error
    messages revealing implementation details, directory listings, source code exposure, debug
    information leaks, metadata exposure, timing-based information leaks, and any mechanism
    through which confidential data becomes accessible to unauthorized parties.
  why: >-
    Information disclosure vulnerabilities are foundational to attack chains because they provide
    attackers with the intelligence needed to plan and execute more sophisticated attacks.
    Leaked information about software versions, configurations, internal architecture, and
    credentials directly enables exploitation of other vulnerability classes. Information
    disclosure is frequently the first step in privilege escalation, lateral movement, and
    data exfiltration attack sequences.
  how: >-
    Information disclosure occurs through multiple mechanisms: verbose error messages revealing
    stack traces and configuration details, improperly configured directory listings exposing
    file structures, debug endpoints left enabled in production, metadata in HTTP headers
    revealing server versions, timing differences in responses revealing valid usernames or
    data existence, source code exposure through backup files or misconfigured servers, and
    improper access controls on sensitive data endpoints.

  embedding_text: >-
    Security Vulnerability (information disclosure) is a broad vulnerability class (CWE-200) where
    systems unintentionally expose sensitive information. Encompasses error messages, directory
    listings, debug endpoints, HTTP header metadata, timing channels, source code exposure, and
    access control failures. Information disclosure is foundational to attack chains providing
    reconnaissance data for privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
    Leaked software versions, configurations, architecture details, and credentials directly
    enable exploitation of other vulnerability classes. Cross-layer, cross-zone impact affecting
    any system exposing sensitive data.
