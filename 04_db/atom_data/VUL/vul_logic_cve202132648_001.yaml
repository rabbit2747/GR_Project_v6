# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2021-32648 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in October CMS that allows
    attackers to reset any user's password including administrator accounts. The password
    reset logic fails to properly validate the reset token, enabling an attacker to send a
    specially crafted password reset request that bypasses token verification and sets a new
    password for any account. CVSS v3 base score: 9.1 (Critical). Exploited in the wild
    against Ukrainian government websites.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability enables complete account takeover of any October CMS user including
    administrators. It was notably exploited in January 2022 against Ukrainian government
    websites as part of cyber operations during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The flaw allows
    full website compromise through administrator account takeover, enabling defacement,
    data exfiltration, and malware deployment.
  how: >-
    An attacker initiates a password reset request for a target account and then sends a
    modified reset completion request with a crafted token value. The password reset logic
    contains a flaw in token validation that accepts certain specially constructed values,
    allowing the attacker to complete the password reset without possessing the legitimate
    reset token. This sets a new password controlled by the attacker.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Password Reset Logic Flaw"
      value: "Token validation in the password reset flow accepts crafted values, enabling unauthorized password changes for any account"
    - key: "Account Takeover Vector"
      value: "Complete administrator account compromise through password reset manipulation without requiring the legitimate reset token"
