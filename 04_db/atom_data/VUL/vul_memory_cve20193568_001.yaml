# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2019-3568 is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CVSS 9.8) in WhatsApp's
    VoIP calling implementation that allows remote code execution by sending specially crafted
    SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) packets during a voice call attempt. The
    vulnerability requires no user interaction beyond the target having WhatsApp installed
    -- the exploit triggers during the call setup before the call is even answered. Disclosed
    in May 2019, it was exploited by NSO Group's Pegasus spyware to compromise smartphones
    of journalists, activists, and political figures worldwide. WhatsApp released a patch
    and later sued NSO Group for exploiting this vulnerability.
  why: >-
    CVE-2019-3568 is landmark because it demonstrated zero-click mobile exploitation at
    scale through a messaging application used by over 1.5 billion people. The exploitation
    by NSO Group for deploying Pegasus spyware on targets including journalists and human
    rights activists became a major international controversy. The WhatsApp lawsuit against
    NSO Group was a watershed moment for the commercial spyware industry. The vulnerability
    highlighted that messaging applications are critical attack surfaces for mobile device
    compromise.
  how: >-
    The exploit sends malformed SRTP packets to the target's WhatsApp client during a VoIP
    call initiation. The buffer overflow in the SRTP stack occurs during packet processing
    before the call is connected or even displayed to the user, making it a zero-click exploit.
    The overflow allows the attacker to overwrite stack memory and redirect execution to
    shellcode that downloads and installs the Pegasus spyware implant. The attack only
    requires knowing the target's phone number. Missed call logs were sometimes deleted to
    eliminate evidence of the exploit attempt.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2019-3568 is a stack-based buffer overflow in WhatsApp's VoIP SRTP stack with
    CVSS 9.8 enabling zero-click remote code execution on mobile devices. Exploited by
    NSO Group to deploy Pegasus spyware on journalists, activists, and political figures
    worldwide, the vulnerability triggers during VoIP call setup before the call is answered,
    requiring no user interaction. Malformed SRTP packets overflow the stack buffer during
    processing, enabling shellcode execution to install surveillance implants. Disclosed in
    May 2019 and affecting over 1.5 billion WhatsApp users, it led to a landmark lawsuit
    by WhatsApp against NSO Group for commercial spyware exploitation.
