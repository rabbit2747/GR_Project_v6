# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Password Security Vulnerabilities is a class of authentication weaknesses encompassing
    insecure password storage, weak hashing algorithms, plaintext credential storage, insufficient
    salting, reversible encryption of passwords, insecure password transmission, and inadequate
    credential lifecycle management. This includes use of deprecated hashing algorithms (MD5,
    SHA-1, unsalted hashes), storing passwords in plaintext or reversible formats, transmitting
    credentials over unencrypted channels, and failing to implement proper key stretching
    (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2).
  why: >-
    Insecure password storage and handling represent foundational security failures that amplify
    the impact of any data breach. When password databases are compromised, weak hashing allows
    rapid offline cracking of credentials, potentially exposing millions of user accounts. Major
    breaches at Adobe (plaintext hints), LinkedIn (unsalted SHA-1), and others demonstrated the
    catastrophic consequences of insecure password storage. These vulnerabilities also enable
    insider threats, as poorly stored credentials can be accessed by database administrators or
    through SQL injection attacks.
  how: >-
    Attackers exploit password security vulnerabilities through database compromise followed by
    offline hash cracking (using tools like Hashcat and John the Ripper), interception of
    plaintext credentials in transit, extraction of passwords from insecure storage (config files,
    logs, memory dumps), and rainbow table attacks against unsalted hashes. Mitigation includes
    implementing modern adaptive hashing (Argon2id preferred, bcrypt minimum), enforcing unique
    per-password salts, transmitting credentials only over TLS, implementing secure credential
    lifecycle management, avoiding password storage where possible (using OAuth/OIDC delegation),
    and regularly auditing password storage implementations.
