# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2011-4369 is a memory corruption vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in the PRC (Product
    Representation Compact) component of Adobe Reader and Acrobat. The vulnerability allows
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary code through a crafted PDF document that embeds
    malicious PRC 3D content. It was exploited as a zero-day alongside CVE-2011-2462 in
    targeted attacks and was patched in APSB12-01 (January 2012). The vulnerability affects
    Adobe Reader and Acrobat versions 9.x through 9.4.6 and 10.x through 10.1.1.
  why: >-
    Scoring CVSS 10.0, this vulnerability was part of a series of zero-day Adobe Reader
    exploits used in sophisticated targeted attacks. The PRC component, used for 3D content
    rendering in PDF documents, provided a complex attack surface. Its exploitation alongside
    CVE-2011-2462 demonstrated coordinated APT campaigns using multiple Adobe Reader zero-days
    to maintain persistent access to target organizations.
  how: >-
    The exploit creates a PDF document containing specially crafted PRC 3D data that triggers
    a memory corruption condition when Adobe Reader parses the embedded content. The corruption
    allows the attacker to manipulate execution flow and achieve arbitrary code execution in
    the context of the Reader process. The malicious PDF is delivered via email or web-based
    vectors targeting specific organizations.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2011-4369 is a critical memory corruption vulnerability with CVSS 10.0 in the PRC
    (Product Representation Compact) 3D component of Adobe Reader and Acrobat. The flaw
    enables remote code execution through crafted PDF documents containing malicious PRC
    data. Exploited as a zero-day alongside CVE-2011-2462 in coordinated APT campaigns
    targeting defense and government organizations, it affected Reader and Acrobat 9.x
    through 9.4.6 and 10.x through 10.1.1. Patched in APSB12-01 in January 2012, this
    vulnerability was part of a broader pattern of Adobe Reader 3D component exploitation
    used in advanced persistent threat operations.
