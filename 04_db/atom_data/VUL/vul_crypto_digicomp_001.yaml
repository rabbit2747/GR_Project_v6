# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The DigiNotar Compromise was a 2011 security breach of the Dutch certificate authority DigiNotar
    in which attackers gained control of the CA's signing infrastructure and issued over 500 fraudulent
    SSL/TLS certificates for high-profile domains including google.com, microsoft.com, and intelligence
    agencies. The breach was discovered when a fraudulent google.com certificate was detected being
    used for man-in-the-middle surveillance of Iranian Gmail users. DigiNotar subsequently declared
    bankruptcy after all major browsers revoked trust in its root certificates.
  why: >-
    The DigiNotar compromise exposed fundamental weaknesses in the PKI trust model, demonstrating
    that the security of HTTPS depends on the weakest certificate authority in the browser trust
    store. A single compromised CA could issue trusted certificates for any domain worldwide. The
    incident catalyzed major improvements to PKI security including Certificate Transparency, CAA
    DNS records, and stricter CA audit requirements. It also revealed state-sponsored surveillance
    operations targeting dissidents.
  how: >-
    Attackers compromised DigiNotar's certificate signing infrastructure through a series of
    intrusions exploiting unpatched servers and inadequate network segmentation. Once they gained
    access to the signing systems, they generated fraudulent SSL certificates for hundreds of
    domains. These certificates were then deployed for man-in-the-middle surveillance, particularly
    targeting Iranian internet users accessing Google services. The attack was detected when
    Chrome's certificate pinning for Google domains flagged the unexpected certificate. Investigation
    revealed over 500 fraudulent certificates had been issued.

    its root certificates. The incident exposed fundamental weaknesses in the PKI trust model
    where a single compromised CA threatens the entire certificate ecosystem. It catalyzed major
    security improvements including Certificate Transparency logs, CAA DNS records, and stricter
    CA audit requirements. The investigation by Fox-IT, published as Operation Black Tulip,
    revealed extensive infrastructure compromise through unpatched servers and poor network
    segmentation at the CA facility.
