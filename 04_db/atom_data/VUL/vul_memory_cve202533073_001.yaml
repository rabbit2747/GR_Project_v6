# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-33073 is a remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS 7.5) in the Windows
    Scripting Engine caused by a memory corruption flaw when processing specially crafted
    web content. The vulnerability is a type confusion in the scripting engine's object
    handling that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the
    current user when a victim visits a malicious webpage or opens malicious content.
    Patched by Microsoft in 2025, the vulnerability affects the scripting engine
    components shared across Microsoft browsers and Windows script hosts. Exploitation
    requires user interaction (visiting a malicious page).
  why: >-
    Scripting engine memory corruption vulnerabilities remain a primary attack vector
    for browser-based exploitation and targeted attacks. CVE-2025-33073 continues the
    pattern of type confusion vulnerabilities in Windows scripting engines that have been
    exploited by APT groups and cybercriminals for initial access. Browser and scripting
    engine vulnerabilities are particularly valuable because they enable remote code
    execution through the most common user activity -- web browsing.
  how: >-
    The exploit crafts malicious web content that triggers a type confusion in the
    Windows Scripting Engine's object type handling system. When the scripting engine
    processes a specially crafted script, it misinterprets the type of an object in
    memory, allowing the attacker to read or write memory at controlled offsets. By
    carefully arranging objects in memory and triggering the type confusion, the attacker
    achieves arbitrary code execution within the browser or script host process. The
    exploit requires the victim to navigate to a malicious page or open malicious content.

    CVE-2025-33073 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Scripting
    Engine with CVSS 7.5, caused by a type confusion in object handling when processing
    malicious web content. The vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution within the
