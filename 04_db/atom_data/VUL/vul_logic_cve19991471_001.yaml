# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-1999-1471 is a directory traversal vulnerability in ICQ Web Front that allows remote
    attackers to read arbitrary files on the host system by using dot-dot-slash (../) sequences
    in HTTP requests to the ICQ personal web server. The web front component fails to properly
    validate URL paths, enabling access to files outside the intended shared directory.
    CVSS v2 base score: 5.0 (Medium).
  why: >-
    ICQ was one of the most popular instant messaging clients in the late 1990s and included
    a personal web server feature allowing users to share files. The directory traversal flaw
    exposed personal files on user workstations to remote attackers, including documents,
    email archives, and system configuration files. This vulnerability was significant because
    ICQ ran on millions of desktop machines with limited security awareness.
  how: >-
    An attacker sends HTTP requests containing ../ directory traversal sequences to the ICQ
    Web Front personal web server. The path validation logic fails to sanitize these sequences
    before file system access, allowing navigation outside the configured shared directory
    to read arbitrary files accessible to the ICQ process running under the user's context.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Personal Web Server Traversal"
      value: "Directory traversal in ICQ's personal web server feature exposes user files beyond the intended shared directory"
    - key: "Desktop Application Exposure"
      value: "Web server functionality embedded in a messaging client creates unexpected network attack surface on user workstations"
