# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2024-1709 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in ConnectWise ScreenConnect
    server versions prior to 23.9.8, also known as SlashAndGrab. The vulnerability allows a
    remote unauthenticated attacker to access the setup wizard of an already-configured
    ScreenConnect instance by appending a trailing path to the setup URL. This grants the attacker
    the ability to create a new administrator account with full control over the ScreenConnect
    server and all managed endpoints. CVSS v3.1 score is 10.0 (Critical).
  why: >-
    This is a maximum severity vulnerability in one of the most widely deployed remote management
    tools, used by thousands of managed service providers (MSPs) to manage millions of endpoints.
    The trivial exploitability (simple URL manipulation) combined with the devastating impact
    (full administrative control) made this one of the most critical vulnerabilities of 2024. It
    was rapidly weaponized by multiple ransomware groups within 24 hours of disclosure, including
    LockBit, Black Basta, and others. A single compromised ScreenConnect server can provide access
    to hundreds of downstream client organizations.
  how: >-
    The attacker accesses the ScreenConnect setup wizard by navigating to a URL path that bypasses
    authentication checks (e.g., appending a path segment after the SetupWizard.aspx endpoint).
    The setup wizard allows creating a new administrator account even on fully configured servers.
    With admin access, the attacker can deploy malicious ScreenConnect extensions, execute commands
    on all managed endpoints, and deploy ransomware at scale. Mitigation includes immediately
    upgrading to ScreenConnect 23.9.8 or later, reviewing administrative accounts for unauthorized
    additions, auditing all connected endpoints for signs of compromise, and implementing network
    segmentation for RMM tools.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2024-1709 is a maximum severity authentication bypass vulnerability in ConnectWise
    ScreenConnect server with CVSS v3.1 score 10.0, known as SlashAndGrab. A remote
    unauthenticated attacker manipulates the URL path to access the setup wizard on a configured
    instance, creating a new administrator account with full control. Weaponized within 24 hours
    of disclosure by LockBit, Black Basta, and other ransomware groups. Affects all versions
    prior to 23.9.8. Compromising an RMM server provides cascading access to all managed
    endpoints, enabling supply-chain-style attacks against MSP client networks. Mitigation requires
    immediate upgrade, auditing admin accounts, checking connected endpoints, and implementing
    network segmentation for management tools.
