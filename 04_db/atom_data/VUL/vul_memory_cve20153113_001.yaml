definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-3113 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in Adobe Flash
    Player that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted Flash content.
    The vulnerability exists in the processing of certain FLV (Flash Video) data. It was
    exploited as a zero-day in June 2015 in Operation Clandestine Wolf, a targeted attack
    campaign attributed to APT3 (Gothic Panda). Adobe released an emergency update to address
    the vulnerability, affecting Flash Player versions before 18.0.0.194.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant for its use in Operation Clandestine Wolf by APT3, a
    Chinese state-sponsored threat group. The attack targeted organizations in the aerospace
    and defense industries through spear-phishing emails containing links to compromised web
    servers hosting the Flash exploit. Flash Player's browser integration meant that visiting
    a malicious URL was sufficient for exploitation, making it an ideal vector for targeted
    attacks.
  how: >-
    The exploit delivers crafted FLV video content through a web page that triggers a heap-based
    buffer overflow in Flash Player's video processing code. The overflow corrupts adjacent heap
    memory, allowing the attacker to manipulate object vtable pointers. Through heap grooming
    techniques, the attacker positions controlled data adjacent to the overflow, enabling
    reliable redirection of execution flow to shellcode that downloads and installs a backdoor.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2015-3113 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability with CVSS 10.0 in Adobe Flash
    Player's FLV video processing code. Malformed FLV data triggers a heap overflow that
    corrupts adjacent memory objects, enabling remote code execution through web-based Flash
    content. Exploited as a zero-day in June 2015 during Operation Clandestine Wolf by APT3
    (Gothic Panda), a Chinese state-sponsored group targeting aerospace and defense organizations
    through spear-phishing with exploit links. Adobe issued an emergency update for Flash
    Player versions before 18.0.0.194. This vulnerability was part of the wave of Flash
    zero-days that accelerated industry efforts to deprecate Flash Player entirely.
