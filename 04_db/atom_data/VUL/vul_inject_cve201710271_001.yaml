# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2017-10271 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server
    caused by unsafe deserialization in the WLS Security (WLS-WSAT) component. The XMLDecoder
    class is used to process user-supplied XML data in SOAP requests without proper input
    validation, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary Java objects. The CVSS v3
    base score is 7.5 and it was disclosed in October 2017. This vulnerability was massively
    exploited for cryptocurrency mining campaigns.
  why: >-
    Oracle WebLogic Server is a leading enterprise Java application server deployed across
    financial institutions, government agencies, and large corporations. The vulnerability
    requires no authentication and is exploitable over HTTP, making it ideal for automated
    mass exploitation. It was widely adopted by cryptomining botnets and APT groups as a
    reliable initial access vector for enterprise network infiltration.
  how: >-
    Attackers send specially crafted SOAP XML requests to the WLS-WSAT endpoint
    (/wls-wsat/CoordinatorPortType). The XML payload contains serialized Java objects that
    the XMLDecoder processes without validation. Through carefully constructed object graphs,
    attackers invoke Runtime.exec() or similar methods to execute operating system commands.
    Common payloads deploy cryptocurrency miners, web shells, or reverse shells. Mitigation
    requires applying Oracle Critical Patch Update or restricting access to WLS-WSAT endpoints.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2017-10271 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server
    caused by unsafe XMLDecoder deserialization in the WLS-WSAT component. With CVSS score 7.5,
    attackers send crafted SOAP XML to the CoordinatorPortType endpoint containing serialized
    Java objects that execute arbitrary commands without authentication. Massively exploited
    for cryptocurrency mining campaigns and APT operations targeting enterprise networks.
    Affects WebLogic Server 10.3.6.0, 12.1.3.0, and 12.2.1.x versions. The vulnerability
    demonstrates the severe risk of using XMLDecoder to process untrusted input in enterprise
    middleware. Mitigation requires Oracle Critical Patch Update application or restricting
    network access to WLS-WSAT endpoints.
