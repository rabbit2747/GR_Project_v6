# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-14750 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server that
    serves as a patch bypass for CVE-2020-14882. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote
    code execution by circumventing the authentication mechanism of the WebLogic Admin Console
    through URL encoding manipulation. CVSS score is 9.8. Disclosed in November 2020 as an
    emergency out-of-band patch after CVE-2020-14882 was found to be insufficiently patched.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability demonstrates the challenge of completely fixing authentication bypass
    vulnerabilities. The original CVE-2020-14882 patch was bypassed within days of release,
    requiring Oracle to issue an emergency out-of-band patch. WebLogic Server is widely deployed
    in enterprise environments, and the trivial nature of exploitation (single HTTP request)
    combined with active exploitation made this an extremely urgent vulnerability.
  how: >-
    The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the WebLogic Admin Console with double URL-encoded
    path traversal characters that bypass the authentication check implemented for CVE-2020-14882.
    The original patch only checked for specific URL patterns, but alternative encodings of the
    same path bypassed the check. Once authentication is bypassed, the attacker accesses the
    console's administrative functions to deploy malicious applications or execute code.

    - name: "Patch Bypass"
      value: "URL encoding variations circumvent the authentication check implemented by the CVE-2020-14882 patch"
    - name: "URL Encoding Evasion"
      value: "Double URL encoding of path traversal characters evades pattern-based input validation"
    - name: "Out-of-Band Emergency Patch"
      value: "Oracle issued emergency patches outside the regular quarterly cycle due to active exploitation"

    CVE-2020-14750 is a critical authentication bypass in Oracle WebLogic Server that serves as a
    patch bypass for CVE-2020-14882. By using double URL-encoded path traversal characters,
    attackers circumvent the authentication check in the WebLogic Admin Console, achieving
    unauthenticated remote code execution with a single HTTP request. CVSS score is 9.8. The
    vulnerability was discovered within days of the CVE-2020-14882 patch release, forcing Oracle
    to issue an emergency out-of-band security update. It demonstrates the difficulty of
    completely fixing authentication bypass vulnerabilities through pattern-based input validation.
    WebLogic Server is widely deployed in enterprise environments and both CVE-2020-14750 and
    CVE-2020-14882 were actively exploited in the wild. Affects WebLogic Server versions
    10.3.6.0 through 14.1.1.0. Listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.
