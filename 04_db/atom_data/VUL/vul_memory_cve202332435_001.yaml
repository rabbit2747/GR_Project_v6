# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-32435 is a memory corruption vulnerability (CVSS 8.8) in Apple's WebKit
    browser engine that allows arbitrary code execution when processing malicious web
    content. The vulnerability exists in WebKit's JavaScript engine and enables remote
    code execution within the browser rendering process. It was exploited as a zero-day
    in the Operation Triangulation spyware campaign discovered by Kaspersky in 2023.
    The exploit was delivered via zero-click iMessage attachments containing invisible
    web content that triggered the WebKit vulnerability without user interaction.
    Apple patched it in iOS 16.5.1 in June 2023.
  why: >-
    CVE-2023-32435 served as the critical initial remote code execution component in
    the Operation Triangulation zero-click attack chain. WebKit vulnerabilities are
    particularly dangerous on iOS because Apple requires all browsers to use the WebKit
    engine, meaning every browser on iOS is affected. The zero-click delivery via
    iMessage made the exploit chain especially dangerous as no user interaction was
    required. This vulnerability demonstrated how browser engine flaws remain the
    primary vector for sophisticated mobile device compromise.
  how: >-
    The exploit delivers malicious web content via an iMessage attachment that is
    automatically processed by the WebKit rendering engine. The crafted content triggers
    a memory corruption condition in WebKit's JavaScript processing, enabling arbitrary
    code execution within the browser sandbox. In the Operation Triangulation chain,
    this initial code execution was then escalated using CVE-2023-32434 (kernel integer
    overflow) and CVE-2023-38606 (hardware register bypass) to achieve full kernel-level
    device compromise and persistent spyware installation.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2023-32435 is a memory corruption vulnerability in Apple WebKit with CVSS 8.8,
    enabling remote code execution through malicious web content. Exploited as a zero-day
    in Operation Triangulation, it was delivered via zero-click iMessage attachments that
    triggered the WebKit flaw without user interaction. As the initial remote code execution
    stage in the attack chain, it enabled subsequent kernel exploitation through
    CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-38606. The vulnerability highlights how WebKit flaws
    affect all iOS browsers due to Apple's engine mandate. Patched in iOS 16.5.1.
