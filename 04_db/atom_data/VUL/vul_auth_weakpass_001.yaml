# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Weak Password Policy is a vulnerability class where authentication systems enforce insufficient
    password complexity, length, rotation, or history requirements, enabling users to create easily
    guessable or crackable passwords. This includes policies allowing short passwords (under 12
    characters), no complexity requirements, no account lockout thresholds, no password history
    enforcement, excessive password age allowances, use of common dictionary words, and failure
    to screen passwords against known-breached credential lists. It also encompasses absence of
    multi-factor authentication as a compensating control.
  why: >-
    Weak password policies are among the most commonly exploited vulnerabilities in enterprise
    environments. Password spraying attacks succeed because organizations allow common patterns
    like Season+Year (Winter2024!) or Company+Number (Acme123). The Verizon DBIR consistently
    reports that compromised credentials are involved in over 80% of breaches. Without strong
    password policies and MFA, organizations remain vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential
    stuffing, dictionary attacks, and social engineering. Default or weak passwords on network
    devices, databases, and service accounts are frequent findings in penetration testing.
  how: >-
    Attackers exploit weak password policies through password spraying (testing common passwords
    against many accounts), brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, credential stuffing with
    leaked passwords, and offline hash cracking of compromised databases. Mitigation includes
    enforcing minimum 14-character passwords, implementing breach detection (NIST 800-63B
    memorized secret screening), deploying multi-factor authentication on all accounts,
    implementing progressive account lockout, using password managers, eliminating periodic
    rotation requirements (per NIST guidance), blocking commonly used passwords, and monitoring
    for authentication anomalies.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Password Complexity vs. Length"
      value: "Modern guidance (NIST 800-63B) emphasizes password length over complexity rules, as complexity requirements often lead to predictable patterns"
    - key: "Defense in Depth Authentication"
      value: "Password policies alone are insufficient; MFA, breach detection, lockout policies, and monitoring together create resilient authentication"

  embedding_text: >-
    Weak Password Policy is a vulnerability class where authentication systems enforce insufficient
    password complexity, length, or screening requirements. Enables password spraying, brute-force,
    dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing. Common patterns like Season+Year succeed because
    policies allow short or predictable passwords. Verizon DBIR reports compromised credentials in
    over 80% of breaches. Modern NIST 800-63B guidance emphasizes length over complexity, breach
    detection screening, and MFA as compensating controls. Mitigation includes 14+ character
    minimums, breached password screening, MFA deployment, progressive lockout, password manager
    adoption, eliminating periodic rotation, and monitoring authentication anomalies. Default
    and weak passwords on devices and service accounts are frequent penetration testing findings.
