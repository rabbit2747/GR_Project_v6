# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2010-2568 (CVSS 9.3) is a critical vulnerability in the Windows Shell that allows
    remote code execution through specially crafted shortcut (.lnk) files. The vulnerability
    exists in the way Windows Shell parses shortcut icons, where a malformed .lnk file can
    cause Windows Explorer to load and execute a malicious DLL when simply displaying the
    shortcut's icon. Most notably exploited by the Stuxnet worm targeting Iranian nuclear
    centrifuges. Patched in MS10-046 (August 2010).
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is historically significant as the primary initial infection vector
    for Stuxnet, the first known cyberweapon targeting industrial control systems. The exploit
    required no user interaction beyond viewing a folder containing the malicious .lnk file,
    making it extremely reliable for USB-based propagation into air-gapped networks. The
    discovery revealed state-sponsored offensive cyber capabilities targeting critical
    infrastructure.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability is triggered when Windows Explorer attempts to display the icon for a
    specially crafted .lnk shortcut file. The malformed shortcut references a Control Panel
    item that causes shell32.dll to load and execute an attacker-specified DLL without any
    user interaction beyond browsing to the folder. Stuxnet used this to spread via USB drives:
    when a USB drive containing the malicious .lnk and payload DLL was inserted and its
    contents viewed in Explorer, the exploit executed automatically. This enabled propagation
    into air-gapped industrial control networks.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2010-2568 is a critical Windows Shell vulnerability (CVSS 9.3, MS10-046) exploited by
    Stuxnet to infiltrate air-gapped industrial control networks. Specially crafted .lnk shortcut
    files cause Windows Explorer to load and execute malicious DLLs when simply displaying the
    shortcut icon, requiring zero user interaction. This vulnerability enabled USB-based
    propagation into Iranian nuclear facilities. Affects Windows XP through Windows 7. The
    discovery revealed state-sponsored cyberweapon capabilities and remains one of the most
    significant vulnerability discoveries in cybersecurity history.
