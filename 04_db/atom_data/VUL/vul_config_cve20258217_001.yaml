definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-8217 is a code injection vulnerability in CI/CD pipeline configurations that allows
    attackers to inject malicious commands into automated build and deployment workflows. The
    vulnerability specifically affects GitHub Actions workflows that use untrusted input (such as
    pull request titles, branch names, or issue content) directly in run steps without proper
    sanitization. This enables arbitrary code execution in the CI/CD environment with access to
    repository secrets and deployment credentials. CVSS v3: 8.3 (High).
  why: >-
    CI/CD pipelines are the central mechanism for building, testing, and deploying software. They
    typically have access to sensitive secrets including deployment keys, cloud credentials, package
    registry tokens, and code signing certificates. Pipeline injection enables supply chain attacks
    where an attacker can modify build outputs, inject backdoors into deployments, exfiltrate secrets,
    and compromise downstream systems. The widespread adoption of GitHub Actions and similar systems
    makes this vulnerability class highly impactful across the software industry.
  how: >-
    The attacker crafts a pull request, issue, or other GitHub event containing malicious shell
    commands in metadata fields (title, body, branch name). When a vulnerable GitHub Actions
    workflow processes this event and interpolates the untrusted data directly into a run step,
    the injected commands execute in the runner environment. This provides access to all repository
    secrets, GITHUB_TOKEN, and any configured deployment credentials. The attacker can then modify
    source code, inject backdoors into build artifacts, publish malicious packages, or pivot to
    connected cloud infrastructure. Mitigation includes using intermediate environment variables
    instead of direct interpolation, validating inputs, and restricting secret access.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2025-8217 is a code injection vulnerability in CI/CD pipeline configurations, specifically
    GitHub Actions workflows that use untrusted input in run steps without sanitization. CVSS v3
    score is 8.3 High. Attackers can inject malicious commands through pull request metadata, branch
    names, or issue content to execute arbitrary code in CI/CD environments with access to repository
    secrets and deployment credentials. Enables supply chain attacks including backdoor injection into
    build artifacts, secret exfiltration, and malicious package publishing. Mitigation includes using
    intermediate environment variables and input validation. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK T1195.002 Supply
    Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain.
