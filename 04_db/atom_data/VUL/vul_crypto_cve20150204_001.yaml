# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-0204 (FREAK - Factoring RSA Export Keys) is a vulnerability where TLS clients,
    including OpenSSL, Apple SecureTransport, and Microsoft SChannel, can be forced to accept
    export-grade RSA keys (512-bit) through a man-in-the-middle downgrade attack. The vulnerability
    exists because clients accept RSA_EXPORT cipher suites even when they were not offered in the
    ClientHello. CVSS score is 4.3. Disclosed in March 2015, the vulnerability traces back to 1990s
    US export restrictions on cryptography.
  why: >-
    FREAK demonstrated that decades-old export cryptography restrictions continued to undermine
    modern security. Export-grade 512-bit RSA keys can be factored in hours using cloud computing
    for approximately $100, making the downgraded connection trivially breakable. The vulnerability
    affected approximately 37% of HTTPS sites and multiple major client implementations, showing
    how legacy cipher suite support creates ongoing security risks.
  how: >-
    The attacker intercepts the TLS handshake and modifies the ClientHello to request an RSA_EXPORT
    cipher suite. When the server supports export ciphers, it responds with a 512-bit RSA key. The
    vulnerable client accepts this weak key despite not having requested export ciphers. The attacker
    then factors the 512-bit RSA key (feasible in hours with cloud computing), recovers the TLS
    master secret, and can decrypt all traffic. The client vulnerability is the acceptance of the
    unexpected ServerKeyExchange message with export-grade parameters.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2015-0204, known as FREAK (Factoring RSA Export Keys), is a TLS downgrade vulnerability
    where clients including OpenSSL, Apple SecureTransport, and Microsoft SChannel can be forced
    to accept export-grade 512-bit RSA keys. A man-in-the-middle attacker modifies the TLS
    handshake to request RSA_EXPORT cipher suites, and vulnerable clients accept the weak key
    despite not requesting it. The 512-bit RSA key can then be factored in hours using cloud
    computing, allowing the attacker to decrypt all traffic. The vulnerability traces back to
    1990s US export restrictions that mandated deliberately weakened cryptography. Disclosed in
    March 2015, FREAK affected approximately 37 percent of HTTPS sites. The fix involves
    removing export cipher suite support from both clients and servers. FREAK demonstrated how
    legacy cryptographic policy decisions continue to undermine modern security and accelerated
    the removal of export cipher suites from TLS implementations. CVSS score is 4.3.
