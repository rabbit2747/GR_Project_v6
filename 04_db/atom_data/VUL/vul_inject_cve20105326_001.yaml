# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2010-5326 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver
    Application Server Java that exploits the Invoker Servlet to execute arbitrary commands
    without authentication. The Invoker Servlet, when enabled, allows direct invocation of
    any Java class accessible to the server by name through HTTP requests. The vulnerability
    has a CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 (Critical) and has been actively exploited in
    nation-state campaigns targeting SAP enterprise systems since its disclosure.
  why: >-
    SAP systems manage critical business processes including financial transactions, human
    resources, and supply chain operations for major organizations worldwide. This vulnerability
    provides complete unauthenticated access to SAP servers, enabling attackers to steal
    sensitive business data, manipulate financial records, or disrupt critical operations.
    The US-CERT issued alerts about active exploitation against over 36 global organizations.
  how: >-
    Attackers send HTTP requests to the Invoker Servlet endpoint that specify arbitrary Java
    classes for direct invocation. Since the servlet provides unauthenticated access to the
    Java class loader, attackers can instantiate and execute any class available in the server
    classpath. This enables execution of system commands, file operations, and complete server
    compromise. The attack requires only HTTP access to the SAP server. Mitigation requires
    disabling the Invoker Servlet through SAP configuration and applying SAP Security Notes.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Invoker Servlet"
      value: "SAP component that allows direct HTTP-based invocation of server-side Java classes without access controls"
    - key: "Unauthenticated RCE"
      value: "Remote code execution requiring no credentials, enabling any network-accessible attacker to fully compromise the system"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2010-5326 is a maximum severity (CVSS 10.0) remote code execution vulnerability in
    SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java. The Invoker Servlet allows unauthenticated HTTP
    requests to directly invoke arbitrary Java classes on the server, enabling complete system
    compromise without credentials. Actively exploited in nation-state campaigns against over
    36 global organizations managing critical business processes. SAP systems handle financial
    transactions, HR data, and supply chain operations, making this vulnerability extremely
    high impact. Exploitation requires only HTTP access to the SAP server. Mitigation involves
    disabling the Invoker Servlet and applying SAP Security Notes. US-CERT issued specific
    alerts about active exploitation of this vulnerability.
