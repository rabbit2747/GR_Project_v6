definition:
  what: "CVE-2019-7161 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Splunk Light versions before 6.6.0 that allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files from the server by exploiting insufficient path validation in the Splunk Light web interface. An authenticated user can craft requests with path traversal sequences to access files outside the intended web root directory."
  why: "Splunk Light is a log management and SIEM solution that typically has access to sensitive operational data, security logs, and configuration files. A directory traversal vulnerability in Splunk allows attackers to read configuration files containing credentials, API keys, and sensitive security monitoring data. Compromising the SIEM itself undermines an organization's ability to detect and respond to security incidents."
  how: "The vulnerability is exploited by sending HTTP requests to the Splunk Light web interface with specially crafted path traversal sequences (e.g., ../ encoded variants) in URL parameters. The server-side code fails to properly sanitize or validate the requested file paths, allowing the request to escape the web root and access arbitrary files on the Splunk server's filesystem. This can reveal Splunk configuration files, saved searches, alert configurations, and system files. Remediation requires updating to Splunk Light 6.6.0 or later."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Path Traversal in SIEM"
      value: "Directory traversal vulnerability in a security monitoring product that allows reading files outside the web root, including sensitive SIEM configuration and log data"
    - key: "Security Tool Compromise"
      value: "Exploitation of security infrastructure components like SIEM systems that undermines the organization's detection and response capabilities"

  embedding_text: "CVE-2019-7161 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Splunk Light before version 6.6.0 that allows remote authenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the server through crafted path traversal requests to the web interface. The vulnerability is significant because Splunk as a SIEM solution has access to sensitive security logs, configuration files containing credentials, and alert configurations. Compromising Splunk undermines organizational detection and response capabilities. Remediation requires updating to Splunk Light 6.6.0 or later. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK T1083 File and Directory Discovery."
