# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2017-12149 is a Java deserialization vulnerability in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
    Application Platform (EAP) that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code. The HttpInvoker component in JBoss does not properly restrict access to
    the ReadOnlyAccessFilter, enabling deserialization of untrusted Java objects sent through
    HTTP requests. The CVSS v3 base score is 9.8 (Critical) and it was disclosed in 2017.
  why: >-
    JBoss EAP is a widely deployed enterprise Java application server used by government
    agencies, financial institutions, and large enterprises. The vulnerability allows complete
    server compromise without any authentication, making it a high-priority target for
    automated exploitation. Java deserialization vulnerabilities in application servers
    became one of the most dangerous vulnerability classes during this period.
  how: >-
    Attackers send crafted HTTP requests containing malicious serialized Java objects to the
    JBoss HttpInvoker endpoint at /invoker/readonly. The server deserializes the objects
    without proper access control or input validation, triggering gadget chains that execute
    arbitrary code. Common exploitation uses the Apache Commons Collections or similar
    libraries as gadget sources. Attackers deploy web shells, reverse shells, or malware
    through the resulting code execution. Mitigation requires removing or restricting access
    to the HttpInvoker and applying Red Hat security patches.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2017-12149 is a critical Java deserialization vulnerability in Red Hat JBoss
    Enterprise Application Platform with CVSS score 9.8. The HttpInvoker component at
    /invoker/readonly deserializes untrusted Java objects from HTTP requests without
    authentication or access control. Attackers exploit gadget chains from libraries like
    Apache Commons Collections to achieve arbitrary code execution. JBoss EAP is widely
    deployed in enterprise environments including government and financial institutions.
    Exploitation enables complete server compromise through web shell deployment or reverse
    shell establishment. This vulnerability is part of the broader Java deserialization
    vulnerability class that affected multiple application servers. Mitigation requires
    removing the HttpInvoker endpoint and applying Red Hat security patches.
