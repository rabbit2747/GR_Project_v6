# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2011-2462 is a memory corruption vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in the Universal 3D (U3D)
    component of Adobe Reader and Acrobat. The flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    code or cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF document containing malicious U3D data.
    It was exploited as a zero-day in targeted attacks before Adobe released an out-of-band
    patch in December 2011. The vulnerability affects Adobe Reader 9.x through 9.4.6 and
    Adobe Reader X 10.x through 10.1.1.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability received a maximum CVSS score of 10.0 and was actively exploited as a
    zero-day in targeted attacks against defense and government organizations. Adobe Reader
    was ubiquitous in enterprise environments, making PDF-based exploits a preferred vector
    for APT campaigns. The U3D component was a recurring source of vulnerabilities in Adobe
    products during this period.
  how: >-
    The exploit crafts a PDF document with specially malformed U3D data that triggers a memory
    corruption condition when parsed by Adobe Reader. The corrupted memory state allows the
    attacker to control execution flow and achieve arbitrary code execution. The malicious PDF
    is typically delivered via spear-phishing email attachments targeting specific organizations.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2011-2462 is a critical memory corruption vulnerability with CVSS 10.0 in the
    Universal 3D (U3D) component of Adobe Reader and Acrobat. The flaw allows remote code
    execution through crafted PDF documents containing malicious U3D data. It was exploited
    as a zero-day in targeted APT attacks against defense and government organizations before
    Adobe issued an emergency patch in December 2011. Affecting Reader 9.x through 9.4.6 and
    10.x through 10.1.1, this vulnerability exemplified the era when PDF-based exploits were
    a primary vector for advanced persistent threat campaigns and spear-phishing operations.
