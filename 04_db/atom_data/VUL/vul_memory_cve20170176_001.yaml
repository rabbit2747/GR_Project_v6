# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2017-0176 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS 8.1) in the
    Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation affecting older Windows
    versions including Windows XP SP3 and Windows Server 2003 SP2. The vulnerability is
    a heap-based buffer overflow in the RDP smart card authentication component that
    allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending
    specially crafted RDP packets. Patched in June 2017, it was part of an unusual
    out-of-band update for the already end-of-life Windows XP and Server 2003 platforms,
    alongside EternalBlue patches, reflecting Microsoft's concern about mass exploitation.
  why: >-
    CVE-2017-0176 is notable because Microsoft issued patches for the already
    end-of-life Windows XP and Server 2003 platforms, indicating the severity and
    potential for mass exploitation. Released in the same timeframe as EternalBlue
    patches, it highlights the critical exposure of RDP services, which are commonly
    exposed to the internet. The vulnerability demonstrates the ongoing risk of legacy
    Windows systems in enterprise environments and the dangers of exposing RDP services
    without proper network segmentation.
  how: >-
    The exploit targets a heap-based buffer overflow in the RDP smart card authentication
    subsystem. An attacker sends specially crafted RDP connection packets that trigger
    the overflow during the authentication negotiation phase. The overflow occurs before
    full authentication is required, enabling unauthenticated remote exploitation.
    Successful exploitation grants code execution as SYSTEM on the target, providing
    complete system compromise through network-accessible RDP services.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2017-0176 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Windows RDP
    with CVSS 8.1, affecting Windows XP SP3 and Server 2003 SP2. A heap-based buffer
    overflow in the RDP smart card authentication component allows unauthenticated
    remote attackers to execute code as SYSTEM. Microsoft issued rare out-of-band
    patches for end-of-life platforms alongside EternalBlue updates in 2017. The
    vulnerability highlights the persistent risk of exposed RDP services and legacy
    Windows systems in enterprise environments.
