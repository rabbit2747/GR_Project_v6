# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2010-1885 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Help and Support Center
    (helpctr.exe) on Windows XP and Server 2003. The flaw exists in the handling of the HCP
    protocol (hcp://) URL validation logic, where insufficient input sanitization allows an
    attacker to craft malicious URLs that escape the intended safe browsing context and execute
    arbitrary commands. CVSS v2 base score: 9.3 (Critical). Actively exploited in the wild.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was disclosed by a Google security researcher as a zero-day after Microsoft
    failed to patch within a 60-day disclosure window, making it immediately exploitable. The
    HCP protocol handler is registered system-wide on Windows XP, meaning any application that
    processes URLs (browsers, email clients, document viewers) could trigger exploitation.
    Active exploitation was observed shortly after public disclosure.
  how: >-
    An attacker crafts a malicious hcp:// URL that exploits insufficient validation in the
    Help Center protocol handler. The URL parsing logic fails to properly sanitize certain
    escape sequences, allowing injection of arbitrary commands into the helpctr.exe process.
    The attack is triggered when a user clicks a malicious link or visits a compromised webpage
    that redirects through the HCP protocol handler.

      value: "HCP protocol URL validation fails to sanitize escape sequences, allowing command injection through the Help Center application"
    - key: "Zero-Day Exploitation"
      value: "Publicly disclosed before patch availability, leading to immediate active exploitation in the wild"
