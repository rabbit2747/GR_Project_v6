definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-6218 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows Group Policy processing that
    allows a domain-authenticated attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM on domain-joined
    Windows machines. The vulnerability exists in how the Group Policy Client service processes
    certain policy objects, enabling an attacker to inject malicious configuration that executes
    with SYSTEM privileges during the next Group Policy refresh cycle. CVSS v3: 7.8 (High).
  why: >-
    Group Policy is the primary mechanism for managing configuration across Windows enterprise
    environments. Every domain-joined Windows machine processes Group Policy Objects (GPOs) at
    regular intervals with SYSTEM privileges. A vulnerability in GPO processing that enables
    privilege escalation affects every domain-joined machine in the organization. Combined with
    any initial foothold in the AD domain, this vulnerability provides a reliable path to SYSTEM
    access on any target machine, making it a powerful tool for lateral movement and persistence.
  how: >-
    The attacker, who has compromised a domain user account, creates or modifies a Group Policy
    Object to include specially crafted configuration data that exploits the vulnerability in the
    Group Policy Client service. When target machines process the modified GPO during their next
    refresh cycle (default: every 90 minutes), the malicious payload executes with SYSTEM
    privileges. The attacker can target specific machines or OUs by linking the malicious GPO
    appropriately. Microsoft released patches addressing the validation flaw in the Group Policy
    Client service. Mitigation includes restricting GPO creation rights, monitoring GPO changes,
    and enabling advanced Group Policy auditing.
