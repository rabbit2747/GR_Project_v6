# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-2387 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Adobe Type Manager Font Driver
    (ATMFD.DLL) in Windows that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
    The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of objects in memory by the font driver
    when processing specially crafted OpenType fonts. It was discovered in the Hacking Team
    data breach of July 2015 and was being actively exploited as a zero-day. CVSS v2 score
    is 7.2.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was part of the Hacking Team arsenal, used in their surveillance
    operations worldwide. The font driver runs in kernel mode, making any vulnerability in it
    a direct path to SYSTEM-level access. After the Hacking Team breach, the exploit code
    became publicly available, increasing the risk of widespread exploitation. Font parsing
    vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous as they can be triggered by rendering documents.
  how: >-
    Exploitation involves loading a specially crafted OpenType font that triggers a memory
    corruption in ATMFD.DLL kernel-mode processing. The corrupted memory state is leveraged
    to achieve arbitrary kernel-mode code execution. The exploit can be delivered through
    documents containing embedded fonts. Mitigation requires applying MS15-077, disabling
    the ATMFD driver in the registry, and implementing exploit mitigation technologies such
    as EMET or Windows Defender Exploit Guard.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2015-2387 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Adobe Type Manager
    Font Driver (ATMFD.DLL) with CVSS v2 score 7.2. Improper handling of objects during
    OpenType font processing allows kernel-mode code execution. Discovered in the 2015
    Hacking Team data breach, this zero-day was used in surveillance operations. The font
    driver runs in kernel mode, providing direct SYSTEM access. Exploitation delivers crafted
    fonts through documents triggering memory corruption. Mitigation requires MS15-077,
    disabling ATMFD in the registry, and exploit mitigation technologies. Affects Windows
    Vista through 8.1 and Server 2003 through 2012 R2.
