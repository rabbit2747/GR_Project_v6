# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-5119 is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in Adobe Flash Player related
    to the ActionScript ByteArray class. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code via crafted Flash content that triggers improper ByteArray object handling.
    This vulnerability gained notoriety when it was discovered in the July 2015 Hacking Team
    data breach, which exposed the exploit as part of their surveillance toolkit. Adobe
    released an emergency patch within days of the disclosure, affecting Flash Player versions
    before 18.0.0.203.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is historically significant because it was leaked in the massive Hacking
    Team data breach, exposing a government-grade surveillance exploit to the public. Within
    hours of the leak, the exploit was integrated into major exploit kits including Angler,
    Nuclear, and Neutrino, causing massive-scale exploitation. The Hacking Team leak
    fundamentally changed the threat landscape by releasing polished zero-day exploits into
    the hands of cybercriminals and accelerated Adobe's timeline to deprecate Flash Player.
  how: >-
    The exploit manipulates the ActionScript 3 ByteArray class by setting a ByteArray's length
    property within a custom valueOf() callback during a sort operation. This creates a
    use-after-free condition where the ByteArray's internal buffer is freed but still accessible.
    The attacker uses this to achieve an arbitrary read/write primitive over process memory,
    which is leveraged to overwrite function pointers and redirect execution to shellcode.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "ByteArray Use-After-Free via valueOf Callback"
      value: "Custom valueOf callback during sort operation modifies ByteArray length, freeing internal buffer while maintaining access for arbitrary read/write"
    - key: "Hacking Team Leak Impact"
      value: "Government surveillance exploit leaked in Hacking Team breach was weaponized in exploit kits within hours, causing mass exploitation"

    CVE-2015-5119 is a use-after-free vulnerability with CVSS 10.0 in Adobe Flash Player's
    ActionScript ByteArray class. A custom valueOf callback during sort operations modifies
    ByteArray length, freeing the internal buffer while maintaining access for arbitrary
    read/write over process memory. Leaked in the July 2015 Hacking Team data breach as
    a government surveillance exploit, it was weaponized in Angler, Nuclear, and Neutrino
    exploit kits within hours, causing massive-scale exploitation. Patched in emergency
    APSB15-16, this vulnerability fundamentally changed the threat landscape by releasing
    polished zero-day exploits to cybercriminals and accelerated industry efforts to
    deprecate Flash Player entirely.
