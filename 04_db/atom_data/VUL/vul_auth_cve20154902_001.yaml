# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-4902 is a security feature bypass vulnerability in Oracle Java SE that allows
    attackers to bypass the Click-to-Play security mechanism designed to prevent automatic
    execution of Java applets. The vulnerability was used by APT28 (Pawn Storm) in targeted
    attacks to silently execute malicious Java applets without displaying the security warning
    dialog to the user. This effectively negates the primary user-consent security control for
    Java applet execution in web browsers. CVSS v2 score is 5.0.
  why: >-
    The Click-to-Play mechanism was Oracle's primary defense against drive-by Java applet
    attacks. Bypassing this control allows silent execution of malicious Java code when users
    visit compromised or malicious websites. APT28 combined this bypass with other Java
    vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution without any user interaction beyond
    visiting a web page, making it a powerful initial access vector.
  how: >-
    Attackers craft a web page with a specially structured Java applet deployment that
    circumvents the Click-to-Play dialog. The vulnerability allows the applet to execute
    without the user seeing or clicking the security warning. Combined with a code execution
    vulnerability, this enables full remote compromise through browser-based attacks.
    Mitigation requires updating Java SE to the October 2015 Critical Patch Update, disabling
    Java browser plugins, or removing Java from systems where it is not required.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2015-4902 is a security feature bypass in Oracle Java SE with CVSS v2 score 5.0
    that allows attackers to bypass the Click-to-Play security mechanism. Used by APT28
    (Pawn Storm) in targeted attacks, it enables silent execution of malicious Java applets
    without displaying security warning dialogs. This negates the primary user-consent
    defense against drive-by Java attacks. Combined with code execution vulnerabilities,
    it provides full remote compromise through browser visits. Mitigation requires Java
    October 2015 CPU, disabling Java browser plugins, or removing Java entirely. Demonstrates
    the danger of security feature bypass vulnerabilities in widely deployed software.
