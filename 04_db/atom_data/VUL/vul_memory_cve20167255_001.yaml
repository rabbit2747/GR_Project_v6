# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2016-7255 is a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVSS 7.8) in the Windows
    Win32k.sys kernel-mode driver caused by improper handling of objects in memory. The
    vulnerability allows a locally authenticated attacker to elevate privileges to SYSTEM
    by running a specially crafted application. It was actively exploited in the wild by
    the APT28 (Fancy Bear) threat group as part of a spear-phishing campaign in late 2016.
    Microsoft patched the flaw in November 2016 (MS16-135). Google's Threat Analysis
    Group disclosed the active exploitation before the patch was available, causing a
    brief controversy between Microsoft and Google regarding responsible disclosure timelines.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was significant due to its active exploitation by a nation-state
    threat actor (APT28/Fancy Bear) as a zero-day in targeted attacks. The Win32k.sys
    component has been a recurring source of privilege escalation vulnerabilities in
    Windows, and CVE-2016-7255 demonstrated the continued value of kernel-level exploits
    for advanced persistent threats. The disclosure controversy between Google and Microsoft
    also highlighted industry tensions around responsible vulnerability disclosure timelines.
  how: >-
    The exploit targets a memory corruption flaw in the Win32k.sys kernel driver by
    invoking specific Win32k system calls with crafted parameters that trigger improper
    object handling. The attacker first gains local code execution through a separate
    vector (such as a browser exploit), then uses CVE-2016-7255 to escalate from a
    sandboxed or low-privilege process to SYSTEM level. APT28 chained this with a
    separate Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2016-7855) for initial code execution
    in their attack campaigns.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2016-7255 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Win32k.sys kernel
    driver with CVSS 7.8, caused by improper handling of objects in memory. Actively
    exploited as a zero-day by APT28 (Fancy Bear) in targeted campaigns in 2016, the flaw
    allows local attackers to escalate to SYSTEM privileges. It was chained with Adobe
    Flash exploits for initial access. Patched in MS16-135 in November 2016, the
    vulnerability highlighted the persistent security challenges in the Win32k kernel
    attack surface and the tensions around responsible disclosure when Google disclosed
    active exploitation before the patch was ready.
