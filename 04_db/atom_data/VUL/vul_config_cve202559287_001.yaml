definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-59287 is a vulnerability in cloud instance metadata service (IMDS) configurations that
    allows attackers to exploit server-side request forgery or misconfigured applications to access
    cloud provider metadata endpoints. The vulnerability enables extraction of temporary IAM
    credentials, instance identity documents, and configuration data from the cloud provider's
    metadata service. This is particularly impactful when IMDSv1 (non-authenticated metadata access)
    is still enabled. CVSS v3: 8.6 (High).
  why: >-
    Cloud instance metadata services provide temporary credentials and configuration data to cloud
    workloads. When accessible through SSRF or application vulnerabilities, attackers can extract IAM
    role credentials that provide access to cloud APIs and resources beyond the compromised instance.
    This vulnerability class has been involved in major cloud breaches including the Capital One
    breach. The continued prevalence of IMDSv1 configurations and SSRF-vulnerable applications makes
    this a persistent risk across cloud deployments.
  how: >-
    The attacker exploits an SSRF vulnerability or misconfigured application to make HTTP requests to
    the cloud metadata endpoint (e.g., 169.254.169.254). The metadata service responds with instance
    identity information, IAM role credentials, user data scripts, and other configuration data. The
    temporary IAM credentials can then be used from outside the cloud environment to access cloud
    services. Mitigation includes enforcing IMDSv2 (which requires session tokens), implementing
    network firewalls blocking metadata access from application containers, and applying principle
    of least privilege to IAM roles.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2025-59287 is a vulnerability in cloud instance metadata service configurations enabling
    credential theft through SSRF or application misconfiguration. Attackers can access cloud
    provider metadata endpoints to extract temporary IAM credentials, instance identity documents,
    and configuration data. CVSS v3 score is 8.6 High. Particularly impactful when IMDSv1
    non-authenticated metadata access is enabled. This vulnerability class has been involved in
    major cloud breaches. Mitigation includes enforcing IMDSv2 with session tokens, network
    firewalling metadata endpoints, and least privilege IAM roles. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK T1552.005
