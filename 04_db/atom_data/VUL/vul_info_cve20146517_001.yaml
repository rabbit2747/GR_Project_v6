# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2014-6517 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the XML Parser component of
    Oracle Database Server versions 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.1, and 12.1.0.2. A remote authenticated
    attacker can exploit this vulnerability via the Oracle Net protocol to read arbitrary files
    from the database server or cause partial denial of service. The vulnerability has a CVSS v2
    base score of 6.8 and affects the confidentiality and availability of the system.
  why: >-
    Oracle Database servers are critical enterprise infrastructure holding sensitive business data.
    Information disclosure from the database server's XML parser can expose configuration files,
    credentials, and internal network information. As a network-accessible vulnerability requiring
    only low-privileged authentication, it presents a significant risk in enterprise environments
    where Oracle databases are widely deployed.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability exists in the Oracle XML Parser component and is exploitable through the
    Oracle Net protocol. An authenticated attacker with network access sends specially crafted
    XML data that exploits the parser's improper handling of external entities or document
    processing. This allows reading of server-side files and can cause partial denial of service
    through resource consumption during XML parsing operations.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "XML Parser Exploitation"
      value: "Oracle Database XML Parser improperly processes XML data allowing file read and denial of service via Oracle Net"
    - key: "Database Server Exposure"
      value: "Network-accessible vulnerability in critical database infrastructure exposing server files to authenticated attackers"

    CVE-2014-6517 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the XML Parser component of
    Oracle Database Server versions 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.1, and 12.1.0.2. Exploitable via Oracle
    Net protocol by authenticated attackers, it allows reading arbitrary server files and partial
    denial of service. CVSS v2 score 6.8. The XML Parser improperly handles crafted XML input
    enabling file system access from the database server. Oracle databases are critical enterprise
    infrastructure making this a significant risk for file disclosure and credential exposure.
