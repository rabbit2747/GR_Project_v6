# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-2291 is a vulnerability in the Intel Ethernet diagnostics driver (iqvw64e.sys)
    that allows local attackers to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with
    kernel privileges through crafted IOCTL calls. The driver accepts IOCTL requests from
    user-mode processes without proper validation, enabling arbitrary memory read/write operations
    in kernel space. This vulnerability is heavily abused in Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver
    (BYOVD) attacks where threat actors load the signed but vulnerable driver to bypass kernel
    protections. CVSS v3.1 score is 7.8.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant primarily as a BYOVD attack vector. Because the driver
    is legitimately signed by Intel, it can be loaded on systems with driver signature
    enforcement enabled. Threat actors including Lazarus Group, InvisiMole, and others have
    used this driver to disable security products, bypass kernel-mode protections, and
    establish kernel-level persistence. It remains one of the most commonly abused BYOVD drivers.
  how: >-
    Attackers load the legitimate signed iqvw64e.sys driver onto a compromised system, then
    send specially crafted IOCTL calls to read or write arbitrary kernel memory. This enables
    disabling security products by patching their kernel callbacks, bypassing process protection
    levels, and establishing kernel-mode execution. Mitigation includes driver blocklisting via
    Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity), and
    monitoring for loading of known vulnerable drivers.

    enabling arbitrary kernel memory read and write operations. This is one of the most
    commonly abused BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attack vectors because the

    includes Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, HVCI, and monitoring for known vulnerable
    driver loading. Impacts include kernel-level code execution, security product bypass,
    and persistent system compromise.
