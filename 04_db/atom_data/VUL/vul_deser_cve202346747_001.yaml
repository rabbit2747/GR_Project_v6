# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-46747 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in F5 BIG-IP's Configuration
    Utility (TMUI) that allows unauthenticated remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in
    the Traffic Management User Interface where a request smuggling technique bypasses the
    authentication mechanism, granting access to administrative functions that enable arbitrary
    code execution. CVSS score is 9.8. Affects BIG-IP versions 13.x through 17.x. Disclosed in
    October 2023 with active exploitation following public proof-of-concept release.
  why: >-
    F5 BIG-IP is one of the most widely deployed application delivery controllers and load
    balancers in enterprise networks. These devices sit at the network edge handling all inbound
    traffic, making them critical infrastructure components. Compromising a BIG-IP device provides
    attackers with the ability to intercept, modify, and redirect all traffic passing through it,
    access internal network segments, and establish persistent access to the network infrastructure.
  how: >-
    The attacker exploits a request smuggling vulnerability in the BIG-IP Configuration Utility's
    Apache/AJP proxy architecture. By crafting specific HTTP requests that exploit differences in
    how the frontend proxy and backend application parse request boundaries, the attacker smuggles
    a request that bypasses the authentication check. Once past authentication, the attacker
    accesses administrative functions that allow executing arbitrary commands on the underlying
    BIG-IP operating system through the management interface.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2023-46747 is a critical authentication bypass and remote code execution vulnerability in
    F5 BIG-IP's Configuration Utility (TMUI). A request smuggling technique exploiting the
    Apache/AJP proxy architecture bypasses authentication, granting access to administrative
    functions for arbitrary code execution. CVSS score is 9.8, affecting BIG-IP versions 13.x
    through 17.x. F5 BIG-IP is one of the most widely deployed application delivery controllers
    and load balancers, sitting at the network edge handling all inbound traffic. Compromise
    enables interception and modification of all network traffic, access to internal network
    segments, and persistent infrastructure access. Actively exploited following public
    proof-of-concept release in October 2023. Mitigation requires immediate patching, restricting
    management interface access to trusted networks, and monitoring for indicators of compromise.
    Listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.
