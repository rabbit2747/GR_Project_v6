definition:
  what: >-
    Vulnerable AutoRun is a vulnerability class where automatic execution mechanisms (autorun, startup
    scripts, scheduled tasks, init systems) are misconfigured in ways that allow attackers to achieve
    code execution or persistence. This includes writable autorun locations, insecure permissions on
    startup scripts, Windows AutoRun/AutoPlay enabled for removable media, misconfigured registry run
    keys, writable cron jobs or systemd unit files, and launch agents/daemons with insufficient
    access controls.
  why: >-
    Automatic execution mechanisms are fundamental to system operation, running critical services and
    processes at boot time or on specific triggers. When these mechanisms have insecure configurations
    or permissions, they provide reliable persistence and privilege escalation vectors for attackers.
    Malware has historically exploited Windows AutoRun on USB drives for propagation (Conficker, Stuxnet).
    Misconfigured startup scripts and cron jobs continue to be common privilege escalation and
    persistence vectors found during penetration tests and incident response investigations.
  how: >-
    On Windows, attackers exploit: AutoRun/AutoPlay for removable media to auto-execute malware;
    writable Registry Run key locations to add persistent executables; writable startup folder entries
    for user or system-level persistence. On Linux, attackers exploit: writable cron job files or
    crontab directories for scheduled execution; misconfigured systemd unit files that load attacker-
    controlled binaries; writable init.d scripts for boot-level persistence; writable profile scripts
    (.bashrc, /etc/profile.d/) for user login execution. Mitigation includes disabling AutoRun for
    removable media, restricting write permissions on startup locations, auditing scheduled tasks and
    services, implementing application whitelisting, and monitoring autostart locations for changes.

      value: "Exploiting operating system mechanisms designed for legitimate automatic program execution to achieve malicious code execution and persistence"
    - key: "Boot and Login Persistence"
      value: "Placing malicious code in autostart locations ensures execution on every system boot or user login without user interaction"
    - key: "Permission-Based Exploitation"
      value: "Insecure file system permissions on autostart locations enable unprivileged users to modify what executes with elevated privileges"

  embedding_text: >-
    Vulnerable AutoRun is a vulnerability class where automatic execution mechanisms are misconfigured,
    enabling code execution and persistence. Includes writable autorun locations, insecure startup
    script permissions, Windows AutoRun/AutoPlay enabled for removable media, misconfigured registry
    run keys, writable cron jobs and systemd unit files, and launch agents with insufficient access
    controls. Historically exploited by malware (Conficker, Stuxnet) for USB propagation. Common
    privilege escalation and persistence vector in penetration tests. Mitigation includes disabling
    removable media AutoRun, restricting permissions on startup locations, auditing scheduled tasks,
    and implementing application whitelisting. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK T1547 Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.
