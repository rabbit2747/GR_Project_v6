# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2014-1776 is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in Microsoft Internet Explorer
    6 through 11 related to the VML (Vector Markup Language) rendering component vgx.dll. The
    vulnerability allows remote code execution when a user visits a crafted website. It was
    exploited as a zero-day in April 2014 in targeted attacks and received widespread attention
    because it affected all supported IE versions and was discovered while Windows XP was no
    longer receiving security updates. Patched in MS14-021 (May 2014) as an emergency out-of-band
    update that exceptionally included Windows XP.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability generated significant public attention because it was the first major
    zero-day discovered after Windows XP end-of-life (April 8, 2014), initially leaving millions
    of XP users permanently vulnerable. The public pressure was so significant that Microsoft made
    the exceptional decision to include XP in the emergency patch. It affected all IE versions
    (6-11), maximizing its impact and demonstrating that even IE 11 on Windows 8.1 was vulnerable.
  how: >-
    The exploit uses JavaScript to manipulate VML content in a way that triggers a use-after-free
    condition in the VML rendering component (vgx.dll). After triggering the use-after-free, the
    exploit uses Flash to perform heap spraying and precisely control the memory layout. The freed
    memory is replaced with attacker-controlled data, and when the dangling pointer is accessed
    during VML rendering, execution is redirected to shellcode.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2014-1776 is a use-after-free vulnerability with CVSS 10.0 in Internet Explorer 6
    through 11 in the VML rendering component vgx.dll. The flaw enables remote code execution
    through crafted web pages that manipulate VML content, combined with Flash heap spraying.
    Exploited as a zero-day in April 2014, it gained major public attention as the first
    critical IE zero-day after Windows XP end-of-life, forcing Microsoft to issue an
    exceptional out-of-band patch including XP. Affecting all IE versions on all Windows
    systems, it was patched in the emergency MS14-021 bulletin in May 2014 and demonstrated
    the enduring vulnerability of Internet Explorer's rendering engine to use-after-free attacks.
