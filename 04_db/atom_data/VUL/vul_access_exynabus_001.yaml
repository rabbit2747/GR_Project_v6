# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Exynos Abuse is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Samsung's Exynos processor kernel
    driver, disclosed in December 2012. The vulnerability exists in the /dev/exynos-mem device
    node which is world-readable and world-writable on affected Samsung Galaxy devices. This
    device provides direct read/write access to physical memory, allowing any application
    running on the device to read and write arbitrary kernel memory. An attacker or malicious
    application can exploit this to escalate privileges to root, bypass all Android security
    controls, and gain complete control of the device. Affected devices include Samsung Galaxy
    S3, Galaxy Note 2, and other devices using Exynos 4210 and 4412 processors.
  why: >-
    The Exynos Abuse vulnerability was significant because it affected millions of Samsung
    Galaxy devices, the most popular Android smartphones at the time. The vulnerability was
    trivially exploitable by any installed application without requiring any special permissions,
    making it dangerous for drive-by attacks through malicious apps on the Google Play Store
    or third-party app stores. The root cause was a fundamental design flaw in the Samsung
    kernel driver that exposed physical memory access without any access control, violating
    basic security principles of privilege separation and least privilege.
  how: >-
    The /dev/exynos-mem device node on affected Samsung devices is accessible to all users
    and applications with no permission checks. An attacker installs a malicious application
    (or exploits an existing app vulnerability) that opens /dev/exynos-mem and uses mmap()
    to map physical memory pages including kernel memory. The attacker can then read sensitive
    data from kernel memory (credentials, encryption keys) and write to kernel memory to
    modify security structures, disable SELinux, or inject code into kernel space. This
    achieves permanent root access on the device. The ExynosAbuse APK proof-of-concept
    demonstrated one-click root access. Samsung released kernel patches to restrict
    /dev/exynos-mem permissions, and custom kernels with the fix were distributed through
    the community before the official patch.

    Exynos Abuse is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Samsung Exynos processor kernel
    driver disclosed December 2012. World-readable /dev/exynos-mem device node provides
    unrestricted physical memory read/write access to any application. Affects Samsung Galaxy
    S3, Note 2, and devices with Exynos 4210/4412 processors. Any installed application
    exploits via mmap() without special permissions, bypassing entire Android security model.
    Enables root access, kernel memory manipulation, SELinux bypass, and credential theft.
    ExynosAbuse APK demonstrated one-click root. Fundamental hardware driver design flaw
    violating privilege separation. Samsung released kernel patches to restrict device
    node permissions.
