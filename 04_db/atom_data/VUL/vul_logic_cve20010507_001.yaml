# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2001-0507 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft IIS 4.0 and 5.0 where
    a flaw in the server-side include (SSI) processing logic allows remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. The vulnerability exists in how IIS processes
    certain types of HTTP requests that interact with the SSI functionality, enabling code
    execution in the SYSTEM security context. CVSS v2 base score: 7.5 (High).
  why: >-
    Exploitation grants SYSTEM-level code execution on Windows servers running IIS, providing
    full control over the web server and potentially the entire host. In 2001, IIS was the
    predominant web server for Windows environments and this vulnerability was part of a
    series of critical flaws that led to widespread exploitation including by the Code Red worm.
  how: >-
    An attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests that exploit the SSI processing logic in
    IIS. The flaw in request handling allows bypassing the normal security context restrictions,
    causing command execution under the SYSTEM account instead of the restricted IUSR account.
    The vulnerability can be triggered remotely without authentication through normal HTTP
    request channels.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "SSI Processing Logic Flaw"
      value: "Server-side include processing fails to properly enforce security context, allowing privilege escalation to SYSTEM"
    - key: "Security Context Bypass"
      value: "HTTP request processing logic error causes code execution in SYSTEM context instead of restricted web server account"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2001-0507 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft IIS 4.0 and 5.0 where
    server-side include processing logic allows remote attackers to execute commands with SYSTEM
    privileges. The flaw bypasses security context restrictions through specially crafted HTTP
    requests. Grants full control over the web server host. Part of MS01-044 cumulative patch.
    CVSS v2 7.5 High. Contributed to the era of widespread IIS exploitation including Code Red.
    Affects Windows NT and 2000 servers. Discovered 2001.
