# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-8651 is an integer overflow vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Adobe Flash Player that
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted Flash content. The vulnerability
    exists in the processing of certain ActionScript operations where an integer overflow leads
    to a buffer allocation smaller than expected, resulting in a heap buffer overflow during
    subsequent data processing. It was exploited as a zero-day in targeted attacks in December
    2015 and was patched in APSB16-01 (January 2016).
  why: >-
    This was one of the last major Flash Player zero-days of 2015, exploited in targeted attacks
    against high-value targets. The vulnerability demonstrated that even as Adobe improved Flash
    security through mitigations like heap isolation, attackers continued to find exploitable
    flaws. It was part of the final wave of Flash zero-days that led to the industry consensus
    to deprecate Flash Player, with major browsers beginning to block Flash by default.
  how: >-
    The exploit triggers an integer overflow during an ActionScript operation that calculates
    the size for a memory allocation. The overflow causes a smaller-than-expected buffer to be
    allocated on the heap. When subsequent data is written to this undersized buffer, a heap
    buffer overflow occurs. The attacker uses heap grooming to position sensitive objects
    adjacent to the overflowed buffer, gaining control over object vtable pointers to redirect
    execution to shellcode.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2015-8651 is an integer overflow vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in Adobe Flash Player
    that leads to heap buffer overflow and arbitrary code execution. An integer overflow during
    size calculation causes undersized heap allocation, and subsequent data writes overflow
    the buffer. Exploited as a zero-day in targeted attacks in December 2015, it was patched
    in APSB16-01 in January 2016. Affecting Flash Player before 20.0.0.267 and 18.x before
    18.0.0.324, this vulnerability was among the final wave of major Flash zero-days that
    contributed to the industry consensus to deprecate Flash Player, with browsers beginning
    to block Flash content by default.
