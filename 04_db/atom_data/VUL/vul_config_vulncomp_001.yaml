definition:
  what: >-
    Vulnerable Components is a root vulnerability class describing the use of software, firmware, or
    hardware components that contain known security vulnerabilities. This encompasses unpatched
    operating systems, outdated application frameworks and libraries, end-of-life software without
    security updates, firmware with known exploits, and third-party dependencies with published CVEs.
    OWASP ranks "Vulnerable and Outdated Components" (A06:2021) as a top web application security risk.
  why: >-
    Organizations typically depend on hundreds to thousands of software components, each of which may
    contain vulnerabilities. The challenge of tracking and patching all components creates persistent
    exposure windows. Attackers actively scan for known vulnerable versions and exploit published
    CVEs, often within hours of disclosure. Supply chain attacks targeting widely-used components
    (Log4Shell, SolarWinds) have demonstrated catastrophic impact. The cost of a breach from an
    unpatched vulnerability far exceeds the cost of patch management, yet many organizations struggle
    with timely patching due to operational complexity and legacy systems.
  how: >-
    Attackers identify vulnerable components through version fingerprinting (HTTP headers, error
    messages, JavaScript libraries), automated vulnerability scanning, and monitoring public CVE
    databases. Exploitation typically uses publicly available proof-of-concept code or exploit
    frameworks (Metasploit). Common targets include: unpatched web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS),
    vulnerable application frameworks (Spring, Struts, Django), outdated JavaScript libraries (jQuery,
    Angular), unpatched network devices (firewalls, switches, VPN appliances), and end-of-life
    operating systems. Mitigation requires comprehensive asset inventory, continuous vulnerability
    scanning, automated patch management, software bill of materials (SBOM), dependency monitoring,
    and end-of-life planning.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Component Inventory and Visibility"
      value: "Maintaining accurate inventory of all software components and their versions is the foundation of vulnerability management"
    - key: "Patch Window Exposure"
      value: "The time between vulnerability disclosure and patch application creates a window of exposure actively exploited by attackers"
    - key: "Supply Chain Dependency Risk"
      value: "Dependencies on third-party components inherit their security vulnerabilities, requiring continuous monitoring of the entire dependency tree"
