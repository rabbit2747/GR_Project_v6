# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2002-0561 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Oracle 9i Application Server
    where the PL/SQL Gateway module allows unauthenticated remote access to protected database
    procedures. The Oracle HTTP Server in 9iAS does not properly restrict access to the PL/SQL
    Gateway, enabling attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary PL/SQL procedures
    through crafted HTTP requests. This vulnerability has a CVSS v2 score of 7.5 and was
    disclosed in 2002.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability exposes enterprise database functionality to unauthenticated remote
    access. Oracle 9iAS was widely deployed in enterprise environments, and the PL/SQL Gateway
    provides direct access to database-stored procedures. Successful exploitation enables
    attackers to query, modify, or delete database contents, execute administrative procedures,
    and potentially gain operating system access through the database server.
  how: >-
    Attackers craft HTTP requests targeting the PL/SQL Gateway endpoints using default or
    predictable URL patterns. The gateway fails to enforce authentication, allowing direct
    invocation of PL/SQL procedures including those for database administration. Mitigation
    requires applying Oracle Critical Patch Updates, restricting PL/SQL Gateway access through
    the Oracle HTTP Server configuration, disabling unnecessary DAD (Database Access Descriptor)
    entries, and implementing network-level access controls.

    CVE-2002-0561 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Oracle 9i Application Server
    PL/SQL Gateway with CVSS v2 score 7.5. The Oracle HTTP Server fails to properly restrict
    access to the PL/SQL Gateway module, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary PL/SQL procedures through crafted HTTP requests. This exposes enterprise database
    functionality including administrative procedures to unauthorized access. Mitigation
    requires applying Oracle patches, restricting gateway access, disabling unnecessary DAD
    entries, and implementing network controls. Impacts include database data exposure,
    modification, deletion, and potential operating system compromise through the database.
