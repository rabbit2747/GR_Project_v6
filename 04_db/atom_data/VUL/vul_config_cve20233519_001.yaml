definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-3519 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler
    ADC (Application Delivery Controller) and Citrix Gateway. The vulnerability exists in the Gateway
    service when configured as a VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, or RDP Proxy. A stack buffer
    overflow in the NSPPE process allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
    on the appliance. CVSS v3: 9.8 (Critical). Disclosed in July 2023 and actively exploited as a
    zero-day before patch availability.
  why: >-
    Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway appliances are deployed at the network perimeter of thousands of
    organizations worldwide, serving as VPN gateways and application delivery controllers. Exploitation
    provides immediate access to internal networks. The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild
    by multiple threat actors including ransomware groups and nation-state actors. CISA issued an
    emergency advisory and added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. Over 15,000
    vulnerable appliances were estimated to be internet-facing at the time of disclosure.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted requests to the Citrix Gateway service
    that trigger a stack buffer overflow in the NSPPE (NetScaler Packet Processing Engine) process.
    The overflow allows the attacker to overwrite the return address on the stack and redirect execution
    to attacker-controlled shellcode. No authentication is required. Post-exploitation, attackers
    typically deploy web shells for persistent access and pivot to internal networks. Citrix released
    patches in July 2023. Organizations were advised to apply patches immediately and check for
    indicators of compromise including web shells in known directories.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2023-3519 is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Citrix
    NetScaler ADC and Citrix Gateway appliances, commonly referred to as CitrixBleed. A stack buffer
    overflow in the NSPPE process allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code without
    authentication when the appliance is configured as a VPN virtual server or proxy. CVSS v3 score
    is 9.8 Critical. Actively exploited as a zero-day by multiple threat actors including ransomware
    groups and nation-state actors. Over 15,000 vulnerable internet-facing appliances were identified
    at disclosure. CISA issued an emergency advisory. Post-exploitation typically involves web shell
    deployment for persistent access and lateral movement into internal networks. Patched by Citrix
    in July 2023. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application.
