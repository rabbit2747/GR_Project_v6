# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2014-1761 is a memory corruption vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Microsoft Word's RTF
    file parser that allows remote code execution when a user opens a specially crafted RTF
    file. The vulnerability exists in how Word handles certain RTF properties, causing a
    stack-based buffer overflow. It was exploited as a zero-day in targeted attacks in March
    2014 before Microsoft patched it in MS14-017 (April 2014). The vulnerability affects
    Word 2003 through 2013 and Office Web Apps.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was actively exploited as a zero-day in targeted attacks and quickly
    became one of the most popular exploitation vectors for APT and cybercrime groups. RTF
    files are commonly allowed through email gateways and can be opened by Outlook's preview
    functionality, expanding the attack surface. Microsoft Word's ubiquity in enterprise
    environments made this vulnerability particularly dangerous for organizations worldwide.
  how: >-
    The exploit crafts a malicious RTF document with specially constructed property values that
    trigger a stack-based buffer overflow during parsing. The overflow corrupts the stack,
    allowing the attacker to overwrite the return address and redirect execution to shellcode.
    The RTF file is typically delivered via email attachment, and in some configurations Outlook
    automatically previews RTF content, enabling exploitation without explicit user file opening.

    - key: "Email-Based Zero-Day Exploitation"
      value: "RTF delivery via email with potential Outlook preview exploitation expanded the attack surface beyond explicit file opening"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2014-1761 is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in Microsoft
    Word's RTF file parser. Malformed RTF property values trigger memory corruption during
    parsing, enabling remote code execution when users open malicious RTF documents. Exploited
    as a zero-day in targeted attacks in March 2014, it was patched in MS14-017 in April 2014.
    Affecting Word 2003 through 2013, the vulnerability was particularly dangerous because
    RTF files pass through email gateways and may be automatically previewed by Outlook.
    It became a widely-used exploitation vector for both APT groups and cybercrime operations
    targeting enterprise environments.
