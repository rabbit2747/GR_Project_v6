# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-1999-0095 is a critical vulnerability in early versions of the Sendmail SMTP server
    where the DEBUG and WIZ commands allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on
    the mail server. The DEBUG command was famously exploited by the Morris Worm in 1988 to
    propagate across the early internet. The vulnerability exists because these debug commands
    were left enabled in production deployments, providing an unauthenticated mechanism for
    remote command execution with the privileges of the Sendmail process, typically root.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability holds historical significance as one of the attack vectors used by the
    Morris Worm, the first major internet worm. It demonstrated the catastrophic risk of leaving
    debug interfaces enabled in production. The ability to execute remote commands as root through
    an SMTP server exposed critical mail infrastructure to complete compromise, affecting a
    significant portion of the early internet.
  how: >-
    Attackers connect to the Sendmail SMTP service and issue DEBUG or WIZ commands, which in
    vulnerable versions provide a command shell or allow arbitrary command execution without
    authentication. The Morris Worm automated this exploitation to spread across networked Unix
    systems. Mitigation requires disabling the DEBUG and WIZ commands in Sendmail configuration,
    upgrading to patched Sendmail versions, and restricting SMTP access to authorized relays.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-1999-0095 is a critical vulnerability in early Sendmail SMTP servers where DEBUG and
    WIZ commands allow unauthenticated remote command execution with root privileges. This
    vulnerability was famously exploited by the 1988 Morris Worm to propagate across the
    early internet. Debug commands left enabled in production provided a command shell to any
    remote attacker connecting to the SMTP service. Mitigation requires disabling DEBUG and
    WIZ commands, upgrading Sendmail, and restricting SMTP access. This vulnerability holds
    historical significance as one of the first widely exploited remote code execution flaws
    and demonstrated the danger of debug interfaces in production systems.
