# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2012-1856 is a remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in the MSCOMCTL.OCX
    ActiveX control, specifically in the TabStrip control handling. The vulnerability allows
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted web pages or Office documents that
    embed a malicious TabStrip ActiveX control. This is a distinct vulnerability from
    CVE-2012-0158 but affects the same MSCOMCTL.OCX component. It was patched in MS12-060
    (August 2012) and affects Microsoft Office 2003, 2007, and 2010.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant because it affected the same widely-deployed MSCOMCTL.OCX
    component as CVE-2012-0158, demonstrating that critical Windows ActiveX controls had
    multiple exploitable flaws. The TabStrip control vulnerability provided an additional
    avenue for document-based attacks when the ListView vulnerability was patched, and was
    used in targeted attacks against organizations.
  how: >-
    The exploit embeds a specially crafted TabStrip ActiveX control in a web page or Office
    document. When the control is instantiated, malformed initialization data triggers a
    memory corruption condition in MSCOMCTL.OCX. The attacker controls the corrupted memory
    to hijack execution flow, achieving arbitrary code execution in the context of the
    hosting application (Internet Explorer or Office).

      value: "Malformed TabStrip control initialization data in MSCOMCTL.OCX triggers memory corruption during ActiveX instantiation"
    - key: "Multiple MSCOMCTL.OCX Vulnerabilities"
      value: "Second critical vulnerability in MSCOMCTL.OCX after CVE-2012-0158, demonstrating systemic ActiveX control weaknesses"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2012-1856 is a remote code execution vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in the MSCOMCTL.OCX
    ActiveX TabStrip control used by Microsoft Office. The flaw allows arbitrary code execution
    through crafted web pages or Office documents that embed a malicious TabStrip control,
    triggering memory corruption during initialization. A companion vulnerability to
    CVE-2012-0158 in the same component, it demonstrated systemic weaknesses in Windows
    ActiveX controls. Patched in MS12-060 in August 2012, affecting Office 2003, 2007, and
    2010, this vulnerability was used in targeted attacks as an alternative when the ListView
    flaw was patched.
