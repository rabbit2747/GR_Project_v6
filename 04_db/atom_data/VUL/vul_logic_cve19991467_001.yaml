# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-1999-1467 is a directory traversal and information disclosure vulnerability in Netscape
    Enterprise Server 3.6 that allows remote attackers to list directory contents and read files
    outside the web root through specially crafted URL requests. The server fails to properly
    validate and canonicalize URL paths containing encoded traversal sequences, allowing bypass
    of access controls. CVSS v2 base score: 5.0 (Medium).
  why: >-
    Directory traversal exposes sensitive server files including configuration data, password
    files, and application source code. In 1999, many organizations relied on Netscape Enterprise
    Server for intranet and internet-facing applications. Exploitation enables reconnaissance
    for further attacks by revealing server structure, installed software versions, and
    configuration details.
  how: >-
    An attacker crafts HTTP requests with URL-encoded directory traversal sequences targeting
    Netscape Enterprise Server 3.6. The server's URL parsing logic fails to properly
    canonicalize these paths before file system access, allowing navigation outside the
    configured document root. This enables reading arbitrary files accessible to the web
    server process and listing directory contents.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "URL Canonicalization Failure"
      value: "Server fails to normalize URL paths before file system access, allowing encoded traversal sequences to escape the document root"
    - key: "Directory Listing Exposure"
      value: "Unintended exposure of server directory structure and file contents through manipulated URL requests"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-1999-1467 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Netscape Enterprise Server 3.6
    allowing remote attackers to list directory contents and read files outside the web root.
    The server fails to properly canonicalize URL paths containing encoded traversal sequences,
    bypassing access controls. Exposes configuration data, password files, and source code.
    Enables reconnaissance through server structure and version disclosure. CVSS v2 5.0 Medium.
    URL parsing logic flaw in the request processing pipeline. Discovered 1999.
