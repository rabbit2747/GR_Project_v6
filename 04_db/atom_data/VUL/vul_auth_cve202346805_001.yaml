# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-46805 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the web component of
    Ivanti Connect Secure (versions 9.x and 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure. The vulnerability
    allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication controls by exploiting
    path traversal in the web interface, gaining access to restricted resources on the VPN
    appliance. When chained with CVE-2024-21887 (command injection), it enables full remote
    code execution as root. CVSS v3.1 score is 8.2. Widely exploited as a zero-day starting
    in December 2023 by Chinese state-sponsored threat actors including UNC5221.
  why: >-
    Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances are deployed at network perimeters of thousands of
    enterprises and government agencies worldwide, making them high-value targets. This
    authentication bypass requires no credentials and is remotely exploitable from the internet,
    providing initial access to protected networks. The vulnerability was exploited at massive
    scale as a zero-day, prompting CISA to issue an emergency directive ordering all federal
    agencies to disconnect affected appliances. The attack chain was used for espionage operations
    targeting defense, government, and technology sectors.
  how: >-
    The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request that exploits a path traversal flaw in the
    Ivanti Connect Secure web interface to bypass authentication checks. This grants access to
    administrative API endpoints without valid credentials. Combined with CVE-2024-21887, the
    attacker injects commands through the authenticated API endpoints to achieve remote code
    execution as root. Mitigation includes applying Ivanti patches, deploying the external
    integrity checking tool (ICT) to detect compromise, performing factory resets before patching,
    and monitoring for indicators of compromise including webshells and modified system files.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2023-46805 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure and
    Policy Secure VPN appliances with CVSS v3.1 score 8.2. A remote unauthenticated attacker
    exploits path traversal in the web interface to bypass authentication and access restricted
    administrative endpoints. When chained with CVE-2024-21887 command injection, it enables
    pre-authentication remote code execution as root. Massively exploited as a zero-day starting
    December 2023 by Chinese state-sponsored group UNC5221 for espionage against government and
    defense targets. CISA issued Emergency Directive ED-24-01 ordering federal agencies to
    disconnect affected devices. Mitigation requires patching, factory reset, integrity checking,
    and monitoring for webshells and persistence mechanisms.
