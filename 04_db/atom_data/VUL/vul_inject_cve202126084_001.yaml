# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2021-26084 is an OGNL injection vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data
    Center that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability
    exists in the Webwork framework OGNL evaluation used by Confluence, where user input is
    processed as OGNL expressions without proper sanitization. The CVSS v3 base score is 9.8
    (Critical) and it was disclosed in August 2021 with mass exploitation following rapidly.
  why: >-
    Atlassian Confluence is deployed by tens of thousands of organizations for documentation
    and collaboration. Many instances are internet-accessible. The US government issued
    emergency alerts about mass exploitation, and the vulnerability was adopted by
    cryptocurrency miners, ransomware groups, and APT actors within days of PoC release.
  how: >-
    Attackers inject OGNL expressions through specific Confluence web forms and URL parameters
    that are processed by the Webwork framework without sanitization. The OGNL expressions
    invoke arbitrary Java methods enabling command execution. Some exploitation paths require
    authentication while others are fully unauthenticated depending on the Confluence
    configuration. Mitigation requires upgrading Confluence to patched versions.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2021-26084 is a critical OGNL injection vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Server
    and Data Center with CVSS score 9.8. The Webwork framework evaluates user input as OGNL
    expressions without sanitization enabling arbitrary code execution. Mass exploitation
    followed disclosure rapidly with cryptocurrency miners ransomware groups and APT actors
    targeting internet-facing Confluence instances. US government issued emergency alerts.
    Some exploitation paths are fully unauthenticated. Part of a series of critical Confluence
    injection vulnerabilities. Mitigation requires upgrading to patched versions.
