definition:
  what: "CVE-2019-0604 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint caused by unsafe deserialization of crafted data sent to the SharePoint application. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code in the context of the SharePoint application pool and the SharePoint server farm account. CVSS v3: 9.8 (Critical). Disclosed in February 2019."
  why: "Microsoft SharePoint is widely deployed in enterprise environments as a collaboration and document management platform, often containing sensitive corporate data. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution on the SharePoint server, providing attackers with initial access to the internal network. The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild by multiple threat actors including nation-state groups. CISA issued an alert regarding active exploitation."
  how: "The vulnerability exists in the way SharePoint handles deserialization of specially crafted XML content submitted to the EntityInstanceIdEncoder endpoint or PickerDialogPage. An attacker sends a crafted request containing a malicious serialized object to a vulnerable SharePoint server. When the server deserializes this object, it executes arbitrary code under the SharePoint application pool identity. No authentication is required for certain exploitation paths. Microsoft released patches in February and March 2019."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "SharePoint Deserialization"
      value: "Unsafe deserialization of XML input in SharePoint's EntityInstanceIdEncoder allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution through crafted serialized objects"
    - key: "Enterprise Collaboration Platform Compromise"
      value: "Exploiting SharePoint provides access to sensitive corporate documents and a foothold within the internal enterprise network for lateral movement"
