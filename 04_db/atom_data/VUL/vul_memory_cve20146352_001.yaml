# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2014-6352 is a remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Windows OLE object
    handling that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by embedding specially crafted OLE
    objects in Office documents. The vulnerability is related to but distinct from CVE-2014-4114,
    representing an incomplete fix for the OLE Package Manager issue. It was exploited as a
    zero-day in October 2014, shortly after the MS14-060 patch for CVE-2014-4114. Microsoft
    patched it in MS14-064 (November 2014).
  why: >-
    This vulnerability demonstrated the difficulty of completely patching design-level flaws
    in complex subsystems like Windows OLE. Coming immediately after the Sandworm vulnerability
    patch, it showed that the initial fix was incomplete and that attackers could quickly find
    bypass techniques. The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild and forced Microsoft
    to issue a Fix-it tool as an interim mitigation while developing the complete patch.
  how: >-
    The exploit embeds specially crafted OLE objects in PowerPoint or other Office documents
    that bypass the CVE-2014-4114 patch restrictions. When the document is opened and the user
    interacts with the embedded object, the OLE handling code executes attacker-controlled
    content. The attack can be triggered when a user is presented with a UAC prompt for an
    embedded executable, or through techniques that bypass UAC entirely on certain configurations.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2014-6352 is a remote code execution vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in Windows OLE
    object handling that allows code execution through crafted Office documents. Representing
    an incomplete fix bypass for CVE-2014-4114 (Sandworm), it was exploited as a zero-day
    in October 2014 shortly after the initial OLE patch. The vulnerability demonstrated the
    difficulty of completely remediating design-level flaws in complex subsystems like Windows
    OLE. Affecting Windows Vista through 8.1, it was patched in MS14-064 in November 2014.
    The rapid discovery of this bypass after the Sandworm patch highlighted the persistent
    security challenges in the Windows OLE subsystem architecture.
