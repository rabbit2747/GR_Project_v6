# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2013-3906 is a memory corruption vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in the Microsoft Graphics
    Component (GDI+) related to the processing of TIFF image files. The vulnerability allows
    remote code execution when a user opens a specially crafted document or visits a web page
    containing a malicious TIFF image. It was exploited as a zero-day in targeted attacks
    through crafted Word documents embedding TIFF images. Microsoft issued a Fix-it workaround
    and patched it in MS13-096 (December 2013).
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was actively exploited as a zero-day in multiple targeted attack campaigns
    including those attributed to the Sandworm and other APT groups. The TIFF image format was
    commonly used in Office documents, making it an effective delivery mechanism. The vulnerability
    in the GDI+ graphics component affected multiple Microsoft products simultaneously, including
    Office, Lync, and Windows itself, broadening the attack surface.
  how: >-
    The exploit embeds a specially crafted TIFF image in a Word document or web page. When the
    TIFF image is processed by the GDI+ component, malformed TIFF data triggers a memory
    corruption condition. The attacker uses heap spraying to position shellcode in predictable
    memory locations, and the corrupted GDI+ state redirects execution to the attacker's code.
    The exploit runs with the privileges of the application processing the image.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2013-3906 is a memory corruption vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in the Microsoft Graphics
    Component (GDI+) triggered by processing malformed TIFF images. Remote attackers achieve
    code execution by embedding crafted TIFF images in Word documents or web pages. Exploited
    as a zero-day in targeted APT campaigns including those attributed to the Sandworm group,
    it affected multiple Microsoft products simultaneously including Office 2003-2010, Lync
    2010-2013, and Windows Vista/Server 2008. Patched in MS13-096 in December 2013, this
    vulnerability demonstrated how shared graphics components create wide attack surfaces
    when image parsing vulnerabilities are exploited through document-based delivery.
