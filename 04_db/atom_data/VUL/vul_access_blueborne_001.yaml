# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    BlueBorne is a collection of eight zero-day Bluetooth vulnerabilities disclosed by Armis
    Labs in September 2017 that affect Android, Linux, Windows, and iOS devices. The
    vulnerabilities allow remote code execution, man-in-the-middle attacks, and information
    disclosure over Bluetooth without requiring pairing or user interaction. CVE-2017-0781
    and CVE-2017-0782 are Android RCE vulnerabilities in BNEP and PAN profiles.
    CVE-2017-1000251 is a Linux kernel RCE in the L2CAP stack. CVE-2017-8628 is a Windows
    logical flaw enabling MITM via Bluetooth Pineapple. The attack vector is airborne,
    requiring only that Bluetooth be enabled on the target device within radio range,
    estimated to affect over 5.3 billion devices at disclosure.
  why: >-
    BlueBorne represented a paradigm shift in Bluetooth security because it demonstrated that
    Bluetooth vulnerabilities could be exploited without any user interaction, device pairing,
    or discoverability. The airborne attack vector meant that any Bluetooth-enabled device
    within approximately 10 meters was vulnerable. The cross-platform nature affecting every
    major operating system and the potential to create self-propagating Bluetooth worms made
    BlueBorne one of the most significant wireless vulnerability discoveries, threatening
    enterprise networks, IoT infrastructure, and mobile devices simultaneously.
  how: >-
    BlueBorne attacks exploit vulnerabilities in Bluetooth protocol implementations at the
    operating system level. The attacker scans for Bluetooth-enabled devices using the
    Bluetooth radio, identifies the target OS through Bluetooth probing, and selects the
    appropriate exploit. On Android, heap overflow vulnerabilities in BNEP allow arbitrary
    code execution with kernel privileges. On Linux, a stack buffer overflow in the L2CAP
    configuration response handler enables kernel-level RCE. On Windows, a logical flaw
    in the Bluetooth Authentication process allows MITM positioning. Exploitation requires
    no pairing, authentication, or discoverable mode. Patches were released by Google,
    Microsoft, and Linux kernel maintainers in September-October 2017.
