# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep) is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft
    Windows Remote Desktop Services (RDS). It affects Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2,
    Windows Server 2008, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. The vulnerability is wormable,
    meaning it can propagate without user interaction. CVSS v3.1 score is 9.8 (Critical).
    An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted requests to RDS via RDP to execute
    arbitrary code on the target system.
  why: >-
    BlueKeep is one of the most critical Windows vulnerabilities discovered in recent years due
    to its wormable nature and pre-authentication exploitation. Similar to EternalBlue (MS17-010),
    it can be weaponized for mass exploitation across networks. Remote Desktop Services are
    widely exposed on the internet, and the vulnerability affects legacy Windows systems still
    prevalent in enterprise and industrial environments. NSA issued a rare advisory urging
    immediate patching.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability exists in the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) pre-authentication handling
    within the RDP kernel driver termdd.sys. An attacker sends specially crafted RDP packets
    to port 3389 that exploit a use-after-free condition in the RDP connection sequence. The
    flaw occurs during the binding of internal channels before authentication completes,
    allowing kernel-level code execution without credentials. The wormable nature means
    compromised systems can automatically scan and exploit other vulnerable systems.

    CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep) is a critical wormable remote code execution vulnerability in
    Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVSS 9.8. Affects Windows 7, Server 2008 R2,
    Server 2008, XP, and Server 2003. Unauthenticated attackers exploit a use-after-free in
    the termdd.sys RDP kernel driver by sending crafted packets to port 3389 before authentication
    completes. The wormable nature allows automatic propagation across networks without user
    interaction, similar to EternalBlue. NSA issued a rare advisory urging immediate patching.
    Widely exposed RDP services and legacy Windows systems make this a significant enterprise
    and industrial control system risk. Discovered May 2019.
