# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2021-26411 is a memory corruption vulnerability (CVSS 8.8) in Internet Explorer's
    MSHTML engine that allows remote code execution through specially crafted web content.
    Discovered by ENKI researchers as being exploited by the Lazarus Group (North Korea) in
    a targeted campaign against security researchers in early 2021, the vulnerability was
    part of a social engineering campaign where researchers were lured to visit malicious
    websites. Microsoft patched it in March 2021. The exploit was later observed being
    reused by other threat actors after technical details became public.
  why: >-
    CVE-2021-26411 gained significant attention because it was used in a novel social
    engineering campaign specifically targeting cybersecurity researchers through fake
    security blogs and collaboration requests. The Lazarus Group's targeting of researchers
    represented an unusual attack on the security community itself. The MSHTML engine's use
    by multiple Windows applications beyond Internet Explorer expanded the potential attack
    surface. The vulnerability demonstrated continued APT interest in browser exploits for
    highly targeted operations.
  how: >-
    The exploit uses a crafted webpage that triggers a double-free or use-after-free
    condition in the MSHTML rendering engine when processing specific HTML/CSS combinations.
    The memory corruption allows the attacker to gain control of execution flow. The Lazarus
    campaign used a fake security blog with embedded malicious MHTML content that triggered
    the vulnerability when visited in Internet Explorer or applications using the MSHTML
    engine. After achieving code execution, the exploit deployed a custom backdoor for
    persistent access to the researcher's development environment.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2021-26411 is a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer's MSHTML
    engine with CVSS 8.8 enabling remote code execution through crafted web content.
    Exploited by the Lazarus Group (North Korea) in a novel campaign targeting cybersecurity
    researchers through fake security blogs and collaboration requests in early 2021. The
    use-after-free in MSHTML occurs when processing specific HTML/CSS combinations. The
    MSHTML engine's use by multiple Windows applications extends the attack surface beyond
    Internet Explorer. Patched in March 2021, the exploit was later reused by other threat
    actors after technical details became public.
