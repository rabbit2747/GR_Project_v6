# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-1701 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows kernel-mode
    driver Win32k.sys. The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of objects in memory
    by the Win32k component, allowing a locally authenticated attacker to run arbitrary code
    in kernel mode. This vulnerability was used in the wild by APT28 (Fancy Bear) as part of
    a multi-stage attack chain, paired with a Flash Player zero-day (CVE-2015-3043) for
    initial code execution. CVSS v2 score is 7.2.
  why: >-
    Win32k.sys is one of the most attacked Windows kernel components due to its large attack
    surface and historical vulnerability density. This vulnerability was actively exploited by
    state-sponsored threat actors (APT28) in targeted operations, demonstrating its value for
    advanced persistent threat campaigns. The combination with browser or plugin exploits made
    it a powerful escalation primitive.
  how: >-
    Exploitation involves a locally running process triggering a use-after-free or memory
    corruption condition in Win32k.sys through specific window management API calls. The
    kernel driver improperly handles objects in memory, enabling the attacker to overwrite
    kernel memory and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. Mitigation requires
    applying Microsoft security updates and monitoring for Win32k exploitation indicators.
