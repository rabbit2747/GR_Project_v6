# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2014-8730 is a variant of the POODLE attack affecting certain TLS 1.x implementations that
    fail to properly validate CBC padding bytes. While TLS 1.0 and later specify that all padding
    bytes must contain the same value, some implementations (notably F5 BIG-IP and A10 Networks load
    balancers) do not enforce this check. This allows the same padding oracle attack as POODLE but
    against TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 connections. CVSS score is 5.0. Disclosed in December 2014.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant because it extends the POODLE attack surface beyond SSL 3.0
    to TLS 1.x, affecting organizations that had disabled SSL 3.0 as a POODLE mitigation but were
    using vulnerable TLS implementations. It demonstrated that implementation-specific padding
    validation failures could reintroduce protocol-level vulnerabilities even in newer protocol
    versions, highlighting the importance of strict specification compliance.
  how: >-
    The attack follows the same methodology as POODLE but targets TLS 1.x implementations that do
    not validate all padding bytes. The attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack and modifies
    the padding of CBC-encrypted TLS records. If the server only checks the last byte of padding
    rather than all padding bytes as required by the TLS specification, the attacker can use a
    padding oracle to decrypt plaintext one byte at a time, extracting cookies and session data.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2014-8730 is a POODLE attack variant affecting TLS 1.x implementations that fail to
    properly validate CBC padding bytes. While TLS 1.0 and later require all padding bytes to
    contain the same value, certain implementations including F5 BIG-IP and A10 Networks load
    balancers only check the last padding byte. This non-compliance allows the same padding oracle
    attack technique used in the original SSL 3.0 POODLE vulnerability to work against TLS 1.0,
    1.1, and 1.2 connections. The attacker performs man-in-the-middle manipulation of CBC padding
    to decrypt plaintext one byte at a time. This vulnerability is significant because it affects
    organizations that disabled SSL 3.0 as a POODLE mitigation but used non-compliant TLS
    implementations. CVSS score is 5.0. The fix requires vendors to implement strict padding
    validation checking all padding bytes as mandated by the TLS specification.
