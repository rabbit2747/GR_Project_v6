# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-4490 is an authorization bypass vulnerability in IBM Business Automation Workflow
    and IBM Business Process Manager that allows authenticated users to escalate their
    privileges through a logic flaw in the access control enforcement. The application fails
    to properly validate authorization for certain administrative functions, allowing a
    lower-privileged user to perform actions reserved for administrators. CVSS v3 base
    score: 6.5 (Medium).
  why: >-
    IBM Business Automation Workflow manages critical business processes in enterprise
    environments. Privilege escalation enables unauthorized users to modify workflows, access
    sensitive business data, and alter process automation rules. This can lead to unauthorized
    business process manipulation and data exposure in organizations relying on these platforms.
  how: >-
    An authenticated user with limited privileges crafts specific API requests that bypass
    the authorization checks in the workflow management interface. The access control logic
    fails to validate the user's role against the requested operation, allowing execution
    of administrative functions with a standard user session.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Authorization Logic Bypass"
      value: "Access control enforcement fails to validate user roles against administrative operations, enabling privilege escalation"
    - key: "Business Process Manipulation"
      value: "Escalated privileges allow unauthorized modification of workflow definitions and business automation rules"
