# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2024-55591 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS and
    FortiProxy products. The vulnerability exists in the Node.js WebSocket module of the
    administrative interface and allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain super-admin
    privileges by sending specially crafted requests to the management interface. It affects
    FortiOS versions 7.0.0 through 7.0.16 and FortiProxy versions 7.0.0 through 7.0.19 and
    7.2.0 through 7.2.12. CVSS v3.1 score is 9.8 (Critical). Actively exploited in the wild
    as a zero-day starting in November 2024.
  why: >-
    Fortinet FortiGate firewalls are among the most widely deployed network security appliances
    globally, protecting enterprise and government networks. This vulnerability grants super-admin
    access without credentials to the management interface, providing complete control over firewall
    rules, VPN configurations, and network routing. Attackers exploited this at scale to create
    rogue administrator accounts, modify firewall policies, establish SSL VPN tunnels for
    persistent access, and pivot into internal networks. The vulnerability was used in campaigns
    targeting critical infrastructure and government organizations.
  how: >-
    The attacker sends crafted requests to the Node.js WebSocket module on the FortiOS/FortiProxy
    administrative interface, bypassing authentication to obtain a valid session token with
    super-admin privileges. With this access, the attacker creates new administrator accounts,
    modifies firewall policies to allow inbound connections, configures SSL VPN portals with new
    user accounts for persistent remote access, and alters routing to intercept traffic. Mitigation
    includes upgrading to patched FortiOS/FortiProxy versions, restricting management interface
    access to trusted networks only, disabling HTTP/HTTPS administrative access on public-facing
    interfaces, monitoring for unauthorized administrator accounts, and auditing VPN and firewall
    policy changes.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2024-55591 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS and
    FortiProxy with CVSS v3.1 score 9.8. A remote unauthenticated attacker exploits the Node.js
    WebSocket module on the management interface to gain super-admin privileges without credentials.
    Affects FortiOS 7.0.0-7.0.16 and FortiProxy 7.0.0-7.0.19 and 7.2.0-7.2.12. Actively
    exploited as a zero-day since November 2024 to create rogue admin accounts, modify firewall
    policies, and establish SSL VPN tunnels for persistent access. FortiGate is one of the most
    widely deployed firewalls globally. Mitigation requires upgrading, restricting management
    interface access, disabling public-facing admin interfaces, and auditing for unauthorized
    accounts and policy changes.
