definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-53770 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Kubernetes API Server's authorization
    subsystem. The vulnerability allows authenticated users with limited RBAC permissions to escalate
    their privileges by exploiting a flaw in how the API server evaluates role bindings during
    authorization decisions. Specifically, crafted API requests can bypass namespace-scoped role
    restrictions and gain cluster-level administrative access. CVSS v3: 8.8 (High).
  why: >-
    Kubernetes is the dominant container orchestration platform powering modern cloud-native
    infrastructure. The API Server is the central control plane component through which all cluster
    operations are authorized. A privilege escalation vulnerability in the authorization subsystem
    undermines the entire RBAC security model, potentially allowing any authenticated user (including
    service accounts from compromised pods) to gain full cluster-admin privileges. This enables
    access to all secrets, workloads, and resources across the entire cluster.
  how: >-
    An authenticated user sends specially crafted API requests that exploit a logic flaw in how the
    API server resolves role bindings across namespaces. The attack involves creating specific
    resource requests that cause the authorization evaluator to incorrectly apply cluster-scoped
    permissions instead of namespace-scoped ones. Once cluster-admin access is obtained, the attacker
    can read all secrets, deploy privileged containers, modify workloads, and access the underlying
    node infrastructure. Kubernetes released patched versions and recommended upgrading immediately.
    Temporary mitigation includes enabling audit logging for authorization decisions and monitoring
    for unusual RBAC escalation patterns.
