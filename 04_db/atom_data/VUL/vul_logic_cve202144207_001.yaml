# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2021-44207 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Acclaim Systems USAHERDS, an
    animal health tracking application used by US state government agencies. The application
    uses hardcoded static ValidationKey and DecryptionKey values in the ASP.NET machineKey
    configuration, enabling attackers to forge ViewState payloads containing malicious
    serialized objects for server-side execution. CVSS v3 base score: 8.1 (High).
  why: >-
    USAHERDS is deployed by multiple US state government agencies for livestock disease
    tracking and animal health management. The hardcoded cryptographic keys allow any attacker
    who discovers the keys to forge ViewState payloads and achieve remote code execution on
    government servers. This vulnerability was exploited by the APT41 (Double Dragon) threat
    group to compromise US state government networks.
  how: >-
    An attacker obtains the hardcoded ValidationKey and DecryptionKey from the USAHERDS
    application. Using these keys, they craft a malicious ASP.NET ViewState payload containing
    serialized objects that execute arbitrary commands when deserialized. The forged ViewState
    is submitted to the application, which validates it against the known keys and processes
    the malicious payload.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys"
      value: "Static machineKey values enable ViewState forgery by any attacker who discovers the hardcoded keys"
    - key: "ViewState Deserialization Chain"
      value: "Forged ViewState payloads containing malicious serialized objects are processed by the server, achieving remote code execution"
