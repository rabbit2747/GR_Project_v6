# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2019-18935 is a critical insecure deserialization vulnerability in Progress Telerik UI for
    ASP.NET AJAX that allows unauthenticated remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in
    the RadAsyncUploadHandler which uses insecure .NET deserialization to process upload requests.
    When combined with knowledge of encryption keys (obtainable via CVE-2017-9248), an attacker
    can execute arbitrary code on the server. CVSS score is 9.8. Added to CISA's Known Exploited
    Vulnerabilities catalog due to active exploitation.
  why: >-
    Telerik UI is one of the most popular commercial UI component libraries for ASP.NET, used in
    thousands of enterprise web applications including government systems. This vulnerability was
    actively exploited by multiple threat actors including APT groups targeting US government
    agencies. CISA issued emergency directives requiring federal agencies to patch, demonstrating
    the severity of the real-world impact.
  how: >-
    The attacker first obtains the Telerik encryption keys, either through CVE-2017-9248 (key
    disclosure) or by exploiting default/hardcoded keys. Using these keys, the attacker crafts a
    serialized .NET object that exploits insecure deserialization in RadAsyncUploadHandler. The
    crafted payload is sent as an encrypted upload request to the Telerik handler endpoint. During
    processing, the server deserializes the malicious object, triggering execution of arbitrary
    .NET code or operating system commands.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2019-18935 is a critical insecure deserialization vulnerability in Progress Telerik UI
    for ASP.NET AJAX that allows unauthenticated remote code execution through the
    RadAsyncUploadHandler component. The vulnerability exploits insecure .NET deserialization
    processing upload requests. Combined with encryption key knowledge from CVE-2017-9248 or
    default keys, attackers craft malicious serialized payloads that execute arbitrary code when
    deserialized. CVSS score is 9.8. The vulnerability was actively exploited by APT groups
    targeting US government agencies, prompting CISA emergency directives. Telerik UI is one of
    the most popular ASP.NET component libraries, making this vulnerability extremely widespread
    in enterprise and government web applications. Mitigation requires upgrading Telerik UI,
    rotating encryption keys, and implementing web application firewall rules. The vulnerability
    is listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.
