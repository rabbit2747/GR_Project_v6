definition:
  what: >-
    Kubernetes Dashboard Exposure is a vulnerability class where the Kubernetes Dashboard web UI is
    deployed with insufficient access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access, view, and
    manage cluster resources. Common misconfigurations include exposing the dashboard externally
    without authentication, granting the dashboard service account excessive RBAC permissions
    (cluster-admin), skipping login requirements through --enable-skip-login flag, and using
    NodePort or LoadBalancer services without network restrictions.
  why: >-
    The Kubernetes Dashboard provides a full web-based management interface for Kubernetes clusters,
    including the ability to view secrets, deploy workloads, exec into containers, and modify cluster
    configurations. When exposed without proper authentication, it provides a trivial entry point for
    attackers to take full control of the Kubernetes cluster. This vulnerability class has been
    responsible for numerous high-profile cryptomining campaigns and data breaches. Tesla's cloud
    infrastructure was compromised through an exposed Kubernetes Dashboard in 2018, demonstrating
    the real-world impact.
  how: >-
    Attackers scan for exposed Kubernetes Dashboard instances on common ports (443, 8443, 30000-32767).
    Common exploitation paths include: accessing dashboards configured with --enable-skip-login to
    bypass authentication entirely; exploiting dashboards bound to the cluster-admin service account
    for full cluster control; using exposed dashboards to deploy privileged containers that escape to
    the host node; and leveraging dashboard access to read Kubernetes secrets containing credentials.
    Mitigation includes requiring authentication tokens, implementing RBAC with minimal permissions
    for the dashboard service account, restricting dashboard access to internal networks only,
    and considering removal of the dashboard in favor of kubectl for production clusters.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Management Interface Exposure"
      value: "Exposing the primary cluster management web interface without authentication provides unauthenticated administrative access to all cluster resources"
    - key: "Excessive Service Account Privileges"
      value: "Dashboard service accounts often receive cluster-admin permissions, meaning any dashboard access equals full cluster control"
    - key: "Container Orchestration Entry Point"
      value: "Exposed dashboards serve as the primary entry point for attacks against Kubernetes infrastructure including cryptomining and data theft"

  embedding_text: >-
    Kubernetes Dashboard Exposure is a vulnerability class where the Kubernetes Dashboard web UI is
    deployed with insufficient access controls. Common misconfigurations include external exposure
    without authentication, excessive service account permissions (cluster-admin), skip-login flag
    enabled, and unrestricted network access. Provides full web-based management including secrets
    viewing, workload deployment, container exec, and cluster configuration. Responsible for
    high-profile breaches including Tesla's cloud infrastructure compromise. Mitigation includes
    requiring authentication tokens, minimal RBAC permissions, internal-only network access, and
    considering dashboard removal for production. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK T1610 Deploy Container.
