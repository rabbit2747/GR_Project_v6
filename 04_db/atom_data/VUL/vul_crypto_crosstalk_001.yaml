definition:
  what: >-
    CrossTalk (CVE-2020-0543, SRBDS) is a transient execution side-channel vulnerability affecting
    Intel processors that allows an attacker to leak data from the special register buffer shared
    across CPU cores. Specifically, it enables extraction of output from the RDRAND and RDSEED
    hardware random number generator instructions executed on other CPU cores, with CVSS score 6.5.
    The vulnerability was disclosed in 2020 and affects a wide range of Intel processors from
    Sandy Bridge through Comet Lake families.
  why: >-
    CrossTalk is critically important because it undermines hardware random number generation, which
    is a foundational primitive for cryptographic key generation, nonce creation, and security-critical
    randomness. Unlike prior speculative execution attacks that were limited to same-core leakage,
    CrossTalk demonstrates cross-core data leakage through a globally shared staging buffer, expanding
    the attack surface significantly especially in cloud and multi-tenant environments.
  how: >-
    The attack exploits the fact that certain instructions (RDRAND, RDSEED, and some MSR reads) use
    a shared staging buffer that is globally visible across all CPU cores. An attacker on one core can
    use transient execution techniques to sample stale data from this buffer after another core has
    executed RDRAND or RDSEED. By repeatedly sampling and filtering the buffer contents, the attacker
    can reconstruct the random numbers generated by victim processes on other cores, compromising
    cryptographic key generation and other security-critical operations.

  embedding_text: >-
    CrossTalk, also known as Special Register Buffer Data Sampling (SRBDS) and tracked as
    CVE-2020-0543, is a transient execution side-channel vulnerability in Intel processors
    that enables cross-core data leakage through a globally shared special register buffer.
    The vulnerability allows an attacker on one CPU core to extract output from RDRAND and
    RDSEED hardware random number generator instructions executed on other cores. This
    compromises hardware random number generation used for cryptographic key generation and
    security-critical operations. The attack exploits a shared staging buffer that retains
    stale data from privileged instructions, accessible through speculative execution
    techniques. CrossTalk affects Intel processors from Sandy Bridge through Comet Lake
    families and is particularly dangerous in cloud and multi-tenant environments where
    core-level isolation is assumed. Intel released microcode updates to mitigate the
    vulnerability by locking the staging buffer during sensitive operations.
