definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-53771 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Kubernetes kubelet's node
    authorization mechanism. The vulnerability allows an attacker who has compromised a single
    Kubernetes node to escalate their access beyond the node's authorized scope, accessing secrets
    and resources belonging to pods scheduled on other nodes. This breaks the node-level isolation
    boundary that is fundamental to the Kubernetes security model. CVSS v3: 8.1 (High).
  why: >-
    The Kubernetes node authorization model is designed to restrict each kubelet to only accessing
    the secrets, configmaps, and persistent volumes associated with pods scheduled on its specific
    node. This vulnerability breaks that isolation boundary, meaning compromise of a single node
    exposes resources across the entire cluster. In multi-tenant Kubernetes environments, this
    enables cross-tenant data access. The vulnerability is particularly impactful in managed
    Kubernetes services (EKS, AKS, GKE) where node isolation is a critical security boundary.
  how: >-
    An attacker who has gained access to a Kubernetes node (through container escape or direct
    node compromise) exploits a flaw in how the kubelet's node authorizer validates resource
    requests. By crafting specific API requests through the kubelet's credentials, the attacker
    can access secrets and configmaps that should only be accessible to pods on other nodes.
    This is achieved by manipulating the node authorization token to request resources outside
    the node's authorized scope. Kubernetes released patched versions addressing the authorization
    validation flaw. Mitigation includes upgrading kubelet components and implementing pod security
    policies that limit container escape vectors.
