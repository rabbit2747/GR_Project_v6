# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2002-0559 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Oracle 9i Application Server PL/SQL
    module (mod_plsql). Multiple buffer overflow conditions exist in the mod_plsql Apache module
    that allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via long parameters in HTTP requests
    processed by the PL/SQL gateway. The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 (High)
    and was disclosed in 2002 affecting Oracle 9i Application Server versions.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant because Oracle 9i Application Server was widely deployed
    in enterprise environments for hosting web-enabled database applications. The PL/SQL gateway
    serves as the bridge between web requests and database-stored procedures, making it a
    critical attack surface. Successful exploitation grants remote code execution on the
    application server without requiring authentication.
  how: >-
    Attackers exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests with
    excessively long parameters to the PL/SQL gateway. The mod_plsql module fails to properly
    validate input length, causing buffer overflow conditions that overwrite adjacent memory.
    By carefully controlling the overflow data, attackers can redirect execution flow to
    injected shellcode, achieving remote code execution on the server. Mitigation requires
    applying Oracle security patches and restricting access to the PL/SQL gateway.

    - key: "PL/SQL Gateway"
      value: "Oracle component that translates HTTP requests into PL/SQL procedure calls, acting as the web-to-database bridge"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2002-0559 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in Oracle 9i Application Server mod_plsql
    module that allows remote code execution. The PL/SQL gateway component fails to validate
    input length in HTTP request parameters, enabling attackers to overflow buffers and execute
    arbitrary code. Affecting Oracle 9iAS with a CVSS score of 7.5, this vulnerability targets
    the critical web-to-database bridge layer. Exploitation requires no authentication and can
    be performed remotely through crafted HTTP requests with oversized parameters. The
    vulnerability highlights risks in application server components that process untrusted
    input for database gateway operations. Mitigation requires Oracle security patches and
    PL/SQL gateway access restrictions.
