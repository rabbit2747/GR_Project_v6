# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2019-0803 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability (CVSS 7.8) in the Windows
    Win32k component that allows a locally authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code
    in kernel mode, gaining SYSTEM privileges. The vulnerability exists due to improper
    handling of objects in memory by the Win32k kernel driver. It was actively exploited
    in the wild as a zero-day before Microsoft patched it in April 2019. The vulnerability
    affects Windows 7 through Windows 10 and corresponding Server editions, making it a
    broadly impactful kernel privilege escalation vector.
  why: >-
    Win32k remains one of the most frequently exploited Windows kernel components due to
    its large attack surface and privileged execution context. CVE-2019-0803 continues the
    pattern of Win32k exploitation seen in CVE-2017-0263 and other predecessors. These
    vulnerabilities are highly valuable to attackers as they provide reliable privilege
    escalation from standard user to SYSTEM, completing attack chains that begin with
    application-level code execution.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability is triggered through improper handling of objects in memory within the
    Win32k kernel-mode driver. An attacker who has already gained local code execution
    exploits the memory handling flaw to corrupt kernel memory structures, enabling execution
    of arbitrary code in kernel mode. Successful exploitation grants SYSTEM privileges on
    the compromised host. The exploit typically requires a companion initial access
    vulnerability for the complete attack chain.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2019-0803 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Win32k
    kernel-mode driver with CVSS 7.8 enabling local privilege escalation to SYSTEM. The
    flaw exists in improper handling of objects in memory by the Win32k component. Actively
    exploited as a zero-day before Microsoft's April 2019 patch, it affects Windows 7
    through 10 and Server 2008 through 2019. This vulnerability continues the pattern of
    Win32k kernel exploitation used for privilege escalation, providing attackers with
    reliable SYSTEM access to complete attack chains that begin with application-level
    code execution through companion vulnerabilities.
