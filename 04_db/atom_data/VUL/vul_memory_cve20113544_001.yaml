# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2011-3544 is a vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in the Java Runtime Environment Rhino script
    engine component that allows remote attackers to bypass the Java sandbox and execute
    arbitrary code. The flaw exists in how the Rhino scripting engine handles certain objects,
    allowing untrusted Java applets to escape the security sandbox. It affects Oracle Java SE
    JDK and JRE 7 and 6 Update 27 and earlier, and was patched in the October 2011 Critical
    Patch Update.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was one of the most exploited Java vulnerabilities, integrated into
    multiple exploit kits including Blackhole and Cool. With a CVSS score of 10.0 and wide
    Java deployment in browsers, it enabled mass drive-by download campaigns. Java browser
    plugin vulnerabilities were the dominant web-based attack vector during 2011-2013,
    affecting all major operating systems where Java was installed.
  how: >-
    The exploit leverages the Rhino script engine to create specially crafted JavaScript code
    that runs within a Java applet context. By manipulating the scripting engine's object
    handling, the attacker bypasses the Java sandbox security restrictions. Once the sandbox
    is escaped, the applet can execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the
    user running the browser, achieving full system access.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2011-3544 is a critical Java sandbox bypass vulnerability with CVSS 10.0 in the
    Rhino script engine component of Oracle Java SE. The flaw allows remote attackers to
    escape the Java sandbox through specially crafted applets that exploit the Rhino scripting
    engine's object handling. Once the sandbox is bypassed, arbitrary code execution is
    achieved with user privileges. Affecting JDK/JRE 7 and 6 Update 27 and earlier, this
    vulnerability was heavily exploited through the Blackhole and Cool exploit kits in mass
    drive-by download campaigns. It exemplified the era when Java browser plugins were the
    dominant web attack vector across all operating systems.
