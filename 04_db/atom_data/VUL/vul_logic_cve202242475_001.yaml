# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2022-42475 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the FortiOS SSL-VPN
    component that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
    commands. The vulnerability exists in the SSL-VPN pre-authentication request processing
    logic where specially crafted requests trigger a heap overflow condition. CVSS v3 base
    score: 9.8 (Critical). Actively exploited as a zero-day.
  why: >-
    Fortinet FortiGate is one of the most widely deployed firewall and VPN platforms globally.
    The SSL-VPN component is internet-facing by design, making this vulnerability directly
    exploitable from the internet. Pre-authentication exploitation provides immediate access
    to the network perimeter device. This was exploited as a zero-day before patch availability,
    with Chinese threat actors among the confirmed exploiters.
  how: >-
    An attacker sends specially crafted requests to the FortiOS SSL-VPN web interface that
    trigger a heap-based buffer overflow in the pre-authentication processing logic. The
    overflow allows overwriting critical heap metadata and function pointers, enabling
    redirection of execution to attacker-controlled code. Exploitation achieves code execution
    with root privileges on the FortiGate appliance.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Pre-Auth Heap Overflow"
      value: "SSL-VPN request processing logic contains a heap buffer overflow exploitable before authentication, enabling unauthenticated RCE"
    - key: "Network Perimeter Compromise"
      value: "Exploitation of internet-facing VPN component provides root access to the network perimeter firewall appliance"
