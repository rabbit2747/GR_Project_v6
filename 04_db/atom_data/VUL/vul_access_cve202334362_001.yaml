# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-34362 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in Progress Software's MOVEit
    Transfer managed file transfer application, disclosed as a zero-day in May 2023 with a
    CVSS score of 9.8. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary SQL statements against the MOVEit Transfer database by sending crafted HTTP
    requests to the web application. Exploitation enables attackers to access, modify, or
    delete data in the MOVEit database, deploy web shells for persistent access, and
    exfiltrate sensitive files transferred through the platform. The vulnerability was
    mass-exploited by the Cl0p ransomware group in a campaign that affected over 2,500
    organizations and 65 million individuals globally.
  why: >-
    MOVEit Transfer is a widely used enterprise managed file transfer solution deployed by
    government agencies, financial institutions, healthcare organizations, and Fortune 500
    companies for secure data exchange. The Cl0p group's mass exploitation campaign beginning
    in late May 2023 represented one of the largest supply chain attacks in history, affecting
    organizations across every sector. Stolen data was used for extortion, with Cl0p
    threatening public release of sensitive files. Notable victims included the US Department
    of Energy, Shell, British Airways, BBC, and numerous financial institutions and government
    agencies.
  how: >-
    Attackers send crafted HTTP requests to the MOVEit Transfer web application exploiting a
    SQL injection vulnerability in the file transfer workflow. The injected SQL queries execute
    against the Microsoft SQL Server database backend with elevated privileges. The attack
    chain typically deploys a web shell (human2.aspx) for persistent access, then executes
    Azure Blob Storage commands to exfiltrate transferred files en masse. The Cl0p group
    automated the exploitation across thousands of internet-facing MOVEit instances. Subsequent
    related vulnerabilities CVE-2023-35036 and CVE-2023-35708 were discovered during
    investigation. Mitigation includes applying Progress patches, checking for web shell
    indicators, auditing database and file access logs, and implementing WAF rules.

    CVE-2023-34362 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability (CVSS 9.8) in Progress MOVEit
    Transfer managed file transfer application. Unauthenticated attackers execute arbitrary
    SQL against MSSQL backend, deploy web shells (human2.aspx), and exfiltrate files via
    Azure Blob Storage. Mass-exploited by Cl0p ransomware group affecting 2,500+ organizations
    and 65 million individuals including US DOE, Shell, BBC, and British Airways. Largest
    supply chain attack of 2023. Subsequent CVE-2023-35036 and CVE-2023-35708 discovered
    during investigation. Mitigation requires patches, web shell detection, database audit,
    and WAF rules. Enterprise managed file transfer as critical attack surface.
