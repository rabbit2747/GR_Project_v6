definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2024-37085 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in VMware ESXi hypervisors when joined to
    an Active Directory domain. The vulnerability allows an attacker who has sufficient Active Directory
    permissions to gain full administrative access to the ESXi host by recreating a previously deleted
    AD group (named 'ESX Admins' by default) and adding attacker-controlled accounts to it. ESXi
    automatically grants full admin rights to members of this AD group without additional verification.
    CVSS v3: 6.8 (Medium).
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was actively exploited by multiple ransomware groups including Storm-0506,
    Storm-1175, Octo Tempest, and Manatee Tempest to deploy ransomware (including Black Basta and
    Akira) across VMware ESXi environments. ESXi hypervisors host critical virtual machine workloads
    across enterprise data centers. Full admin access to ESXi enables attackers to encrypt or destroy
    all hosted virtual machines simultaneously, maximizing ransomware impact. Microsoft Threat
    Intelligence reported widespread exploitation starting in mid-2024.
  how: >-
    The attack requires the adversary to first compromise an Active Directory account with permissions
    to create security groups or modify group membership. The attacker creates (or re-creates if
    previously deleted) an AD security group named 'ESX Admins'. They then add a controlled user
    account to this group. When ESXi synchronizes with Active Directory, it automatically grants
    full administrative privileges to all members of the 'ESX Admins' group. The attacker then
    connects to ESXi with these elevated privileges to deploy ransomware across all hosted VMs.
    VMware released patches in June 2024. Mitigation includes renaming the default admin group,
    hardening AD group permissions, and monitoring for group recreation events.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2024-37085 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in VMware ESXi hypervisors when joined to
    Active Directory. Attackers with AD group creation permissions can recreate the default ESX Admins
    group and gain full administrative access to ESXi hosts. CVSS v3 score is 6.8 Medium. Actively
    exploited by ransomware groups including Storm-0506, Storm-1175, Octo Tempest, and Manatee Tempest
    to deploy Black Basta and Akira ransomware across VMware ESXi environments. Full ESXi admin access
    enables encryption of all hosted virtual machines. VMware released patches in June 2024. Mitigation
    includes renaming the default admin group and hardening AD group permissions. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK
