# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2006-0265 is a vulnerability in BEA WebLogic Server versions 7.0 and 8.1 that allows
    remote attackers to inject malicious content or manipulate application behavior through
    improperly validated input. The vulnerability exists in the handling of certain request
    parameters that are not properly sanitized before being processed by the application server.
    This flaw has a CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 (Medium) and was disclosed in 2006.
  why: >-
    BEA WebLogic Server was one of the most widely deployed Java application servers in
    enterprise environments during this period. Injection vulnerabilities in the application
    server itself affect all applications hosted on the platform, creating a broad attack surface
    across multiple organizations. The vulnerability enables attackers to manipulate server
    behavior without requiring valid credentials.
  how: >-
    Exploitation involves sending crafted requests to the WebLogic Server that contain malicious
    input in parameters processed by vulnerable server components. The server fails to properly
    validate or sanitize this input, allowing injection of commands or data manipulation.
    Attackers can leverage this to alter application logic, access unauthorized data, or
    potentially execute code. Remediation requires applying BEA security patches and implementing
    input validation at the application server level.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Application Server Injection"
      value: "Injection targeting the application server platform itself rather than individual applications"
    - key: "Input Validation Failure"
      value: "Server-level failure to sanitize request parameters before processing by internal components"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2006-0265 is an injection vulnerability in BEA WebLogic Server versions 7.0 and 8.1
    that allows remote attackers to manipulate application behavior through improperly validated
    input. The WebLogic application server fails to sanitize certain request parameters before
    internal processing, enabling injection attacks. With a CVSS score of 5.0, this flaw
    affects all applications hosted on vulnerable WebLogic instances. Exploitation does not
    require authentication and can be performed remotely through crafted HTTP requests. This
    vulnerability represents an early example of injection flaws in enterprise Java application
    servers that would later lead to more critical WebLogic vulnerabilities including
    deserialization and XMLDecoder injection issues.
