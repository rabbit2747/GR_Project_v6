# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2012-1525 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in Adobe Reader
    and Acrobat that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
    service via a crafted PDF document. The vulnerability exists in the processing of certain
    data structures within PDF files, where insufficient bounds checking leads to heap memory
    corruption. It was patched by Adobe in APSB12-16 (August 2012) and affects Reader and
    Acrobat versions 9.x before 9.5.2 and 10.x before 10.1.4.
  why: >-
    With a maximum CVSS score of 10.0, this vulnerability posed a critical risk to organizations
    using Adobe Reader. Heap-based buffer overflows in PDF parsers were a reliable exploitation
    primitive during this era, and Adobe Reader's massive installation base made it a high-value
    target. The vulnerability could be exploited through email attachments or malicious web
    content embedding PDF files.
  how: >-
    The exploit crafts a PDF document with malformed data structures that trigger a heap-based
    buffer overflow during parsing. The overflow corrupts heap metadata, allowing the attacker
    to achieve an arbitrary write primitive. Through heap manipulation techniques such as heap
    feng shui, the attacker controls the layout of heap allocations to redirect execution flow
    to shellcode, achieving arbitrary code execution in the context of the Adobe Reader process.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2012-1525 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability with CVSS 10.0 in Adobe
    Reader and Acrobat. The flaw occurs during parsing of malformed PDF data structures where
    insufficient bounds checking causes heap memory corruption. Remote attackers can execute
    arbitrary code by delivering crafted PDF documents via email or web content. Affecting
    Reader and Acrobat 9.x before 9.5.2 and 10.x before 10.1.4, it was patched in APSB12-16
    in August 2012. This vulnerability exemplified the class of heap-based PDF parsing flaws
    that made Adobe Reader a primary target for both targeted and opportunistic attacks.
