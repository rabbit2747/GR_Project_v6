# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Broken Authentication refers to implementation weaknesses in authentication and session
    management functions that allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
    or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities. This includes
    credential stuffing when known breached username-password lists are used, brute-force attacks
    due to missing rate limiting, permitting weak or well-known passwords, ineffective credential
    recovery processes, plaintext or weakly hashed password storage, absent or ineffective
    multi-factor authentication, and session identifier exposure in URLs.
  why: >-
    Broken authentication is consistently ranked among the most dangerous application security
    risks. Attackers have access to billions of valid username-password combinations from
    data breaches. The automated nature of credential stuffing and brute-force tools makes
    exploitation trivial. Successful exploitation leads to complete account takeover, identity
    theft, unauthorized transactions, and exposure of sensitive personal and financial data.
  how: >-
    Attackers exploit broken authentication through automated credential stuffing using breach
    databases, brute-force attacks against login endpoints without rate limiting, session
    fixation or hijacking through insecure token handling, and exploitation of weak password
    recovery flows. Mitigation requires implementing multi-factor authentication, avoiding
    default credentials, checking passwords against known breached lists, enforcing password
    complexity and length, hardening credential recovery paths, using secure session management
    with server-side storage, and implementing progressive delays on failed login attempts.

    - key: "Session Fixation"
      value: "Attack where an attacker sets a users session ID to a known value before authentication, then hijacks the authenticated session"
    - key: "Multi-Factor Bypass"
      value: "Techniques to circumvent additional authentication factors through implementation flaws, social engineering, or protocol weaknesses"

  embedding_text: >-
    Broken Authentication encompasses implementation weaknesses in authentication and session
    management that allow attackers to compromise credentials, keys, or session tokens to
    assume other users identities. This includes credential stuffing with breached password
    lists, brute-force attacks without rate limiting, weak password policies, ineffective
    credential recovery, plaintext password storage, missing multi-factor authentication,
    and session ID exposure. Mitigation requires multi-factor authentication, breach-checked
    passwords, secure session management with server-side storage, progressive login delays,
    and hardened credential recovery. Impacts include account takeover, identity theft, and
    unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.
