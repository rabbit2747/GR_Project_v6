definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2014-3566 (POODLE - Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) is a vulnerability in
    SSL 3.0 that allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to decrypt individual bytes of encrypted traffic
    by exploiting the non-deterministic padding in SSL 3.0 CBC mode cipher suites. The attack works
    by forcing a protocol downgrade from TLS to SSL 3.0 and then exploiting the padding oracle.
    CVSS score is 3.4. Discovered by Google researchers Bodo Moller, Thai Duong, and Krzysztof
    Kotowicz in October 2014.
  why: >-
    POODLE was the final nail in the coffin for SSL 3.0, a protocol that had been deprecated but
    remained widely supported for backwards compatibility. The attack demonstrated that SSL 3.0 was
    fundamentally insecure and could not be fixed without breaking the protocol. It forced the
    industry to finally disable SSL 3.0 support and adopt TLS 1.0 or later as the minimum protocol
    version, accelerating the deprecation of legacy encryption.
  how: >-
    The attacker first forces a protocol downgrade from TLS to SSL 3.0 by interfering with the
    handshake (e.g., injecting TCP RST packets during TLS negotiation). Once SSL 3.0 is established
    with a CBC cipher suite, the attacker exploits the fact that SSL 3.0 does not specify the content
    of padding bytes (only the last byte must equal the padding length). The attacker can modify the
    last block of ciphertext and observe whether the server accepts the modified padding. Through
    approximately 256 attempts per byte, the attacker can decrypt each byte of the plaintext,
    extracting cookies and session tokens.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Padding Oracle"
      value: "SSL 3.0 non-deterministic padding allows attackers to distinguish valid from invalid padding, creating an oracle for decryption"
    - name: "Protocol Downgrade"
      value: "Forcing fallback from TLS to SSL 3.0 through handshake interference to exploit the weaker protocol"
    - name: "CBC Block Manipulation"
      value: "Modifying ciphertext blocks and observing server responses to decrypt plaintext one byte at a time"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2014-3566, known as POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption), is a
    vulnerability in SSL 3.0 that enables man-in-the-middle attackers to decrypt encrypted traffic
    by exploiting non-deterministic padding in CBC mode cipher suites. The attacker forces a
    protocol downgrade from TLS to SSL 3.0 by interfering with the handshake, then exploits the
    fact that SSL 3.0 does not specify padding byte contents. By modifying the last ciphertext
    block and observing server responses, the attacker can decrypt each byte in approximately 256
    attempts. Discovered by Google researchers in October 2014, POODLE was the final justification
    for disabling SSL 3.0 entirely. The vulnerability could not be fixed without breaking the SSL
    3.0 protocol, forcing industry-wide adoption of TLS 1.0 as the minimum supported version.
    Mitigations include disabling SSL 3.0, implementing TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to prevent protocol
    downgrades, and preferring AEAD cipher suites over CBC modes. CVSS score is 3.4.
