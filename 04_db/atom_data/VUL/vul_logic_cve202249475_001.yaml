# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2022-49475 is a logic flaw in the Linux kernel mt76 WiFi driver (MediaTek chipset
    driver) involving improper handling of concurrent operations. The vulnerability exists
    in the driver's state management logic where race conditions between firmware operations
    and driver state transitions can lead to use-after-free conditions or null pointer
    dereferences, potentially causing kernel crashes or enabling privilege escalation.
  why: >-
    MediaTek WiFi chipsets are widely used in consumer and enterprise wireless devices. A
    kernel driver vulnerability can be exploited for local privilege escalation on any Linux
    system using the affected WiFi hardware. The flaw affects the stability and security of
    wireless networking on Linux systems with MediaTek WiFi adapters.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability is triggered through specific sequences of WiFi operations that expose
    a race condition in the mt76 driver's state management logic. Concurrent access to driver
    state during firmware operations causes improper resource handling, leading to memory
    corruption. An attacker with local access can trigger the condition through crafted
    WiFi operations.
