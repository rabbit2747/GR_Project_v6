# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2014-4114 is a remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in the Windows OLE
    Package Manager (packager.dll) that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by embedding
    OLE objects in Office documents, particularly PowerPoint presentations. The vulnerability
    does not involve memory corruption but rather a design flaw allowing OLE objects to download
    and execute files from external sources. It was exploited as a zero-day by the Russian
    Sandworm APT group in espionage campaigns against NATO and European targets. Patched in
    MS14-060 (October 2014).
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is historically significant as the Sandworm vulnerability, used by a
    Russian state-sponsored APT group in espionage campaigns targeting NATO, the European Union,
    Ukrainian government entities, and energy companies. The iSIGHT Partners (now Mandiant)
    discovery and attribution to the Sandworm team marked a major milestone in public
    attribution of nation-state cyber operations. The vulnerability demonstrated that design
    flaws in document embedding could be as dangerous as memory corruption.
  how: >-
    The exploit embeds specially crafted OLE objects in a PowerPoint presentation that reference
    external INF and GIF files via UNC paths or URLs. When the presentation is opened, the OLE
    Package Manager automatically downloads the referenced files. The INF file is then executed
    by Windows, which installs a malicious payload. This is a design-level vulnerability rather
    than a memory corruption bug, as the OLE Package Manager was never intended to restrict
    external file execution.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2014-4114 is a remote code execution vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in the Windows OLE
    Package Manager (packager.dll) allowing arbitrary code execution through crafted Office
    documents. Unlike typical memory corruption, this is a design flaw enabling OLE objects
    to download and execute external files automatically. Known as the Sandworm vulnerability,
    it was exploited as a zero-day by the Russian state-sponsored Sandworm APT group in
    espionage campaigns against NATO, EU, and Ukrainian entities. Patched in MS14-060 in
    October 2014, its discovery by iSIGHT Partners marked a major milestone in public
    attribution of nation-state cyber operations targeting geopolitical adversaries.
