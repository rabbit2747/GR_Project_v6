# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2010-3332 is a cryptographic padding oracle vulnerability in Microsoft ASP.NET that
    allows remote attackers to decrypt and tamper with encrypted data including ViewState,
    forms authentication tickets, and session cookies. The ASP.NET framework returns different
    error responses for valid versus invalid padding in CBC-mode encrypted data, creating an
    information side-channel that enables plaintext recovery. CVSS v2 base score: 5.0 (Medium).
  why: >-
    The padding oracle attack allows decryption of any data encrypted by ASP.NET without
    knowledge of the encryption key. Attackers can decrypt ViewState data to extract sensitive
    information, forge authentication tickets to impersonate users, and download arbitrary files
    from the web server including web.config containing database connection strings and
    machine keys. This affected virtually all ASP.NET applications worldwide.
  how: >-
    An attacker sends modified ciphertext blocks to the ASP.NET application and observes the
    error responses. Different HTTP error codes or error page content reveal whether the CBC
    padding was valid, creating an oracle. Through iterative queries (typically 128 requests
    per byte), the attacker recovers plaintext without the key. The attack exploits the
    fundamental logic of how ASP.NET processes and validates encrypted data.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Padding Oracle Side-Channel"
      value: "Differential error responses for valid vs. invalid CBC padding enable byte-by-byte plaintext recovery without the encryption key"
    - key: "Cryptographic Logic Flaw"
      value: "Application logic exposes padding validation results through error handling, violating the principle of indistinguishable error responses"
