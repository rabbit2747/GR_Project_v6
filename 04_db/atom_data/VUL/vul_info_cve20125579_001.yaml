# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2012-5579 is an information disclosure vulnerability in MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker)
    before version 1.2.12. The application fails to properly enforce access controls on certain
    pages, allowing remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about bug reports and project
    configurations that should be restricted. Unauthorized users can access private bug details,
    project metadata, and potentially user information through improperly protected endpoints.
  why: >-
    Bug tracking systems contain sensitive information about software vulnerabilities, security
    issues, and development roadmaps. Information disclosure from these systems can reveal
    unpatched vulnerabilities in production software, giving attackers detailed knowledge of
    exploitable weaknesses. Access control failures in project management tools represent a
    significant intelligence gathering opportunity for threat actors.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control validation in MantisBT page handlers.
    Certain endpoints fail to verify whether the requesting user has appropriate permissions to
    view the requested data. Remote attackers can craft requests to access restricted bug reports,
    project configurations, and user details without proper authorization by directly accessing
    vulnerable endpoints.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Access Control Bypass"
      value: "Insufficient permission validation allows unauthorized access to restricted bug reports and project data"
    - key: "Development Intelligence Leak"
      value: "Exposed bug tracker data reveals unpatched vulnerabilities and development roadmaps to attackers"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2012-5579 is an information disclosure vulnerability in MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker)
    before version 1.2.12. Insufficient access control validation allows remote attackers to
    access restricted bug reports, project configurations, and user information without proper
    authorization. Bug tracking systems contain sensitive data about unpatched vulnerabilities
    and development roadmaps. This disclosure gives attackers intelligence about exploitable
    weaknesses in production software. The vulnerability results from missing permission checks
    on certain page handlers in the web application. Discovered in 2012.
