# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2024-1708 is a path traversal vulnerability in ConnectWise ScreenConnect server versions
    prior to 23.9.8 that allows an authenticated attacker to execute remote code by uploading
    files to unintended directories on the server. The vulnerability exists in the file upload
    functionality and enables arbitrary file writes outside the intended upload directory. When
    combined with CVE-2024-1709 (authentication bypass), it allows unauthenticated remote code
    execution. CVSS v3.1 score is 8.4.
  why: >-
    ConnectWise ScreenConnect is a widely deployed remote management and monitoring (RMM) tool
    used by managed service providers (MSPs) and IT departments worldwide, managing millions of
    endpoints. The combination of this path traversal with the authentication bypass
    (CVE-2024-1709) created a devastating pre-authentication RCE chain that was rapidly exploited
    by ransomware operators including LockBit affiliates. Compromise of an RMM tool grants
    attackers privileged access to all managed endpoints, enabling supply-chain-style attacks
    against MSP customer networks.
  how: >-
    An attacker exploits the path traversal by manipulating file upload paths to write arbitrary
    files outside the intended directory. Combined with CVE-2024-1709 for initial access without
    credentials, the attacker uploads malicious extensions or executables to achieve code execution
    on the ScreenConnect server. From the compromised server, the attacker can deploy malware or
    ransomware to all managed endpoints. Mitigation includes upgrading to ScreenConnect version
    23.9.8 or later, monitoring for unauthorized administrative accounts, and auditing ScreenConnect
    extensions and file system changes.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2024-1708 is a path traversal vulnerability in ConnectWise ScreenConnect server versions
    prior to 23.9.8 with CVSS v3.1 score 8.4. An attacker manipulates file upload paths to write
    arbitrary files outside the intended directory, enabling remote code execution. When combined
    with CVE-2024-1709 authentication bypass, it creates a pre-authentication RCE chain. Rapidly
    exploited by ransomware operators including LockBit affiliates, compromising managed service
    providers and their client networks. ScreenConnect is a widely deployed RMM tool, making
    compromise especially impactful as a supply chain attack vector. Mitigation requires upgrading
    to version 23.9.8 or later and auditing for unauthorized accounts and file system changes.
