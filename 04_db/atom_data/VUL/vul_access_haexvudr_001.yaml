definition:
  what: >-
    HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver (HEVD) is an intentionally vulnerable Windows kernel
    driver created by Ashfaq Ansari of HackSys Inc as an educational platform for learning
    Windows kernel exploitation techniques. The driver contains deliberate security
    vulnerabilities including stack buffer overflow, heap overflow, use-after-free, type
    confusion, integer overflow, null pointer dereference, uninitialized stack variable,
    uninitialized heap variable, double fetch, insecure kernel resource access, pool overflow,
    and arbitrary overwrite. Each vulnerability represents a real-world kernel exploitation
    primitive that security researchers and red team operators encounter in production
    Windows kernel drivers.
  why: >-
    HEVD is significant in the cybersecurity ontology because it catalogs the most common and
    critical kernel driver vulnerability classes found in real-world Windows systems. The
    driver serves as a training ground for developing exploitation skills used against
    production kernel vulnerabilities such as those found in antivirus drivers, GPU drivers,
    and system utilities. Understanding HEVD vulnerability classes is essential for both
    offensive security researchers developing kernel exploits and defensive teams building
    kernel exploit detection and prevention capabilities. The techniques demonstrated apply
    directly to real CVEs in production drivers.
  how: >-
    Each vulnerability in HEVD is accessible through IOCTL (Input/Output Control) codes sent
    from user-mode to the kernel driver. For example, the stack buffer overflow vulnerability
    accepts oversized input through DeviceIoControl, allowing the attacker to overwrite the
    kernel stack and redirect execution to shellcode. The use-after-free vulnerability allows
    allocation, freeing, and reuse of a kernel object to achieve controlled code execution.
    Exploitation typically involves crafting a user-mode exploit that sends malicious IOCTL
    payloads, corrupts kernel memory structures, and achieves SYSTEM-level code execution
    through token stealing shellcode. HEVD supports multiple Windows versions (7 through 11)
    and both x86 and x64 architectures. The project is open source on GitHub.
