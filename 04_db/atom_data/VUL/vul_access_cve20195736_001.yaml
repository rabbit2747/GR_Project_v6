# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2019-5736 is a critical container escape vulnerability in runc, the OCI runtime used
    by Docker, containerd, Podman, and CRI-O, disclosed in February 2019 with a CVSS score
    of 8.6. The vulnerability allows a malicious container to overwrite the host runc binary
    and thereby gain root-level code execution on the host system. The flaw exists in how runc
    handles the /proc/self/exe file descriptor during container initialization. By crafting a
    container image or exec command that exploits this file descriptor leak, an attacker can
    escape the container namespace isolation and execute arbitrary commands on the host with
    root privileges, completely undermining container security boundaries.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was a watershed moment for container security because runc is the
    foundational OCI runtime used by virtually all Linux container platforms. A container
    escape from a multi-tenant or orchestrated environment (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
    compromises the host and all co-located containers. The vulnerability demonstrated that
    container isolation is not equivalent to virtual machine isolation and that kernel-level
    container runtimes present a critical attack surface. Cloud providers including AWS, GCP,
    and Azure issued emergency advisories and patching guidance for their container services.
  how: >-
    The exploitation requires the attacker to either control a container image or have exec
    access to a running container. The attack works by exploiting a file descriptor race
    condition in runc. When runc executes inside a container (during docker exec or container
    start), the container process can access /proc/self/exe which points to the host runc
    binary through the /proc filesystem. The malicious container process overwrites the host
    runc binary with a payload. The next invocation of runc on the host executes the
    attacker's code with root privileges. Mitigation includes updating runc to 1.0-rc7 or
    later, using read-only container runtimes, implementing SELinux or AppArmor policies,
    and running containers as non-root users. Kubernetes 1.12.6+ includes the patched runc.

    Achieves root-level code execution on the host, compromising all co-located containers.
    Exploitable through malicious container images or exec commands. Watershed moment for
    container security demonstrating that container isolation is not equivalent to VM isolation.
    Affects all major container platforms. Mitigation requires runc update to 1.0-rc7+,
    read-only runtimes, SELinux/AppArmor, and non-root containers.
