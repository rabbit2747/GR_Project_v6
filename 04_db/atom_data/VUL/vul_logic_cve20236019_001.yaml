# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-6019 is a critical command injection vulnerability in Anyscale Ray, an open-source
    AI/ML framework used for distributed computing. The vulnerability exists in the Ray
    dashboard's job submission API where user-supplied input is passed to system commands
    without proper sanitization, enabling remote code execution. The Ray dashboard API is
    exposed without authentication by default. CVSS v3 base score: 9.8 (Critical).
  why: >-
    Ray is widely adopted for AI/ML workloads at major technology companies and research
    institutions. The framework runs on GPU clusters processing sensitive training data and
    models. Unauthenticated RCE on Ray clusters enables theft of AI models, training data,
    and computational resources. The lack of default authentication on the dashboard API
    makes internet-exposed instances immediately exploitable.
  how: >-
    An attacker sends a crafted job submission request to the Ray dashboard API containing
    shell metacharacters in the job parameters. The API processing logic passes these
    parameters to system commands without sanitization. Since the Ray dashboard lacks
    authentication by default, the attack requires no credentials and can be executed
    against any network-accessible Ray instance.

      value: "Job submission API passes unsanitized user input to system commands, enabling command injection on AI/ML compute clusters"
    - key: "Default No-Auth Exposure"
