# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2010-3338 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Task Scheduler
    that allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. The flaw
    exists in how the Task Scheduler validates integrity levels of scheduled tasks, where a
    logic error in the CRC validation of task XML files allows modification of task parameters
    including the execution privilege level. CVSS v2 base score: 6.9 (Medium). Notably
    exploited by the Stuxnet worm.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was famously exploited by Stuxnet, the first known cyber weapon targeting
    industrial control systems. Stuxnet used this flaw to escalate privileges on compromised
    Windows systems as part of its propagation and persistence strategy. The vulnerability
    allows any authenticated user to gain SYSTEM privileges, enabling full system compromise
    from a low-privilege foothold.
  how: >-
    An attacker modifies the XML definition of a scheduled task, changing the privilege level
    from limited user to SYSTEM. The Task Scheduler uses a CRC-based integrity check to
    validate task files, but the CRC algorithm has a logic flaw that allows recalculation
    after modification, bypassing the integrity verification. The modified task then executes
    with SYSTEM privileges on its next scheduled run.

      value: "CRC-based validation of task XML files can be recalculated after modification, nullifying the integrity protection"

      value: "Used by the Stuxnet worm for privilege escalation as part of the first known cyber weapon targeting ICS infrastructure"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2010-3338 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows Task Scheduler allowing
    SYSTEM-level code execution. The CRC-based integrity check on task XML files has a logic
    flaw enabling recalculation after modification, bypassing validation. Famously exploited
    by the Stuxnet worm targeting Iranian nuclear facilities. Affects Windows Vista, 7, and
    Server 2008. CVSS v2 6.9 Medium. Patched in MS10-092. Integrity validation logic bypass
    enabling local privilege escalation to SYSTEM. Year 2010.
