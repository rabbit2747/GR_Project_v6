# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-10189 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in Zoho ManageEngine Desktop
    Central that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The
    FileStorage getReceiverServlet endpoint deserializes untrusted data without proper
    validation, enabling attackers to inject malicious Java objects. The CVSS v3 base score
    is 9.8 (Critical) and it was disclosed in March 2020, with active exploitation by APT
    groups including APT41.
  why: >-
    ManageEngine Desktop Central is an endpoint management platform deployed in enterprise
    environments for managing thousands of endpoints. Compromising the management server
    provides attackers with the ability to deploy malware to all managed endpoints, making
    it an extremely high-value target for supply chain and mass deployment attacks.
  how: >-
    Attackers send crafted serialized Java objects to the FileStorage getReceiverServlet
    endpoint without authentication. The server deserializes the malicious objects, triggering
    gadget chains that execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. APT41 exploited this
    vulnerability to deploy custom malware across victim networks. Mitigation requires
    upgrading ManageEngine Desktop Central to version 10.0.474 or later.
