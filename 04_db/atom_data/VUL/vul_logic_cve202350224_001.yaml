# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-50224 is an authorization bypass vulnerability in Sitecore Experience Platform
    that allows remote attackers to access restricted functionality and data through improper
    access control logic. The vulnerability exists in the authorization checking mechanism
    where certain API endpoints fail to properly validate user permissions, enabling
    unauthorized access to content management functions and sensitive data.
  why: >-
    Sitecore Experience Platform is a major enterprise content management system used by
    large organizations for web content delivery and digital experience management.
    Authorization bypass allows attackers to access restricted content, modify web content,
    and potentially achieve further compromise through exposed management functionality.
  how: >-
    An attacker identifies API endpoints in the Sitecore platform that have insufficient
    authorization checks. By crafting specific requests to these endpoints, the attacker
    bypasses the intended access control logic and gains access to restricted management
    functions or sensitive data without proper authorization.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Authorization Check Logic Gap"
      value: "Certain API endpoints lack proper permission validation, allowing unauthorized access to restricted CMS functions"
    - key: "CMS Access Control Bypass"
      value: "Insufficient authorization enforcement in content management endpoints exposes administrative functions to unauthorized users"
