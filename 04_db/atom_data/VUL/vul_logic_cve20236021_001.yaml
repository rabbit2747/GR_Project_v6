# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-6021 is an arbitrary file read vulnerability in Anyscale Ray that allows
    unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the Ray server filesystem. The
    vulnerability exists in the dashboard log viewer functionality where file path parameters
    are not properly validated, enabling directory traversal to access files outside the
    intended log directory. CVSS v3 base score: 7.5 (High).
  why: >-
    File read on Ray cluster nodes exposes AI model files, training datasets, configuration
    files containing credentials, SSH keys, and other sensitive data. Ray clusters often
    process proprietary AI models and sensitive training data. Combined with the lack of
    default authentication, this allows unauthenticated extraction of valuable intellectual
    property and credentials.
  how: >-
    An attacker sends a request to the Ray dashboard log viewer endpoint with directory
    traversal sequences in the file path parameter. The log viewer's path processing logic
    fails to sanitize traversal sequences, allowing access to arbitrary files on the server
    filesystem. The file contents are returned in the HTTP response to the attacker.
