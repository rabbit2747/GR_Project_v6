definition:
  what: "CVE-2023-34048 is a critical out-of-bounds write vulnerability in VMware vCenter Server's implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A remote attacker with network access to vCenter Server can trigger the out-of-bounds write to achieve remote code execution without authentication. The vulnerability exists in the vCenter Server's handling of DCERPC protocol messages."
  why: "VMware vCenter Server is the central management platform for enterprise virtualization infrastructure. Unauthenticated remote code execution on vCenter provides immediate administrative access to all managed ESXi hosts and virtual machines. This vulnerability was exploited in the wild by UNC3886 (Chinese state-sponsored group) and was retroactively identified as having been exploited since at least late 2021, predating its public disclosure. CISA added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. VMware took the unusual step of releasing patches for end-of-life vCenter Server versions."
  how: "The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted DCERPC protocol messages to the vCenter Server over the network. The malformed messages trigger an out-of-bounds write condition in the DCERPC implementation, allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and achieve code execution as the vCenter Server process. No authentication is required. Exploitation provides full administrative access to the vCenter Server, and from there, all managed VMware infrastructure. VMware released patches for vCenter Server 7.0, 8.0, and even end-of-life 6.7 and 6.5 versions. CVSS v3: 9.8 (Critical)."
