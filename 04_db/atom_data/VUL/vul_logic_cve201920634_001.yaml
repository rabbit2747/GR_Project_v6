# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2019-20634 is a security bypass vulnerability in Proofpoint Email Protection's URL
    Defense feature that allows attackers to craft URLs that evade the URL rewriting and
    scanning logic. The URL processing logic fails to properly handle certain URL encoding
    schemes and redirect patterns, allowing malicious links to pass through the protection
    system without being rewritten or scanned. CVSS v3 base score: 5.3 (Medium).
  why: >-
    Proofpoint Email Protection is widely deployed in enterprise environments to protect
    against phishing and malicious URLs in email. Bypassing the URL defense mechanism allows
    attackers to deliver phishing links and malware download URLs directly to users without
    the expected security scanning and warning pages. This undermines a critical layer of
    email security.
  how: >-
    An attacker crafts URLs with specific encoding patterns or redirect chains that exploit
    parsing inconsistencies in Proofpoint's URL rewriting logic. The URL defense system fails
    to recognize these crafted URLs as needing rewriting, allowing them to reach end users
    in their original form without Proofpoint's click-time protection and scanning.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "URL Rewriting Logic Bypass"
      value: "Crafted URL encoding patterns exploit parsing inconsistencies to evade the email protection URL defense system"
    - key: "Security Gateway Evasion"
      value: "Bypassing URL scanning removes click-time protection, allowing malicious links to reach users unmodified"
