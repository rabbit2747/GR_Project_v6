definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-49704 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS and
    FortiProxy products. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass
    authentication on the administrative management interface through crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.
    Successful exploitation grants access to device configuration, including the ability to modify
    firewall rules, VPN settings, and administrative credentials. CVSS v3: 9.6 (Critical).
    Disclosed in early 2025 and confirmed to have been exploited in the wild.
  why: >-
    Fortinet FortiGate firewalls are among the most widely deployed network security appliances
    globally, protecting perimeter networks for enterprises, government agencies, and critical
    infrastructure. Administrative access to a FortiGate allows attackers to disable security
    controls, modify routing, exfiltrate VPN credentials, and create persistent backdoor access.
    This vulnerability follows a pattern of critical Fortinet authentication bypass CVEs that have
    been actively exploited by nation-state actors and ransomware groups. The management interface
    exposure on internet-facing appliances makes this particularly dangerous.
  how: >-
    The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests to the FortiOS management interface
    that bypass the authentication mechanism. The crafted requests exploit a flaw in how FortiOS
    validates session tokens for administrative API endpoints. Once authentication is bypassed, the
    attacker can access all administrative functions including configuration backup and modification,
    user creation, firewall policy changes, and VPN configuration extraction. Fortinet released
    emergency patches and recommended disabling HTTP/HTTPS administrative access from the internet,
    using trusted host restrictions, and monitoring for unauthorized configuration changes.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2025-49704 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy
    products allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to access the administrative management interface.
    CVSS v3 score is 9.6 Critical. Successful exploitation grants access to device configuration
    including firewall rules, VPN settings, and administrative credentials. Fortinet FortiGate firewalls
    are among the most widely deployed network security appliances globally. Continues a pattern of
    critical Fortinet authentication bypass vulnerabilities exploited by nation-state actors and
    ransomware groups. Mitigation includes disabling internet-facing management access and applying
    emergency patches. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application.
