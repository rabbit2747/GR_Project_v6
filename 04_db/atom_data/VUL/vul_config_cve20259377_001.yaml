definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-9377 is a DNS rebinding vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass network access
    controls and access internal services by exploiting DNS resolution behavior. The vulnerability
    exists in applications and services that rely on DNS-based host validation without implementing
    DNS rebinding protections. An attacker can manipulate DNS responses to first resolve to an
    external IP (passing validation) and then rebind to an internal IP (bypassing network controls).
    CVSS v3: 7.5 (High).
  why: >-
    DNS rebinding attacks undermine the same-origin policy and network segmentation controls that
    protect internal services. Many organizations assume internal services are safe from external
    access, but DNS rebinding allows external web pages to make requests to internal IP addresses
    through the victim's browser. This enables access to internal dashboards, APIs, IoT devices,
    cloud metadata services, and other services that lack authentication because they assume
    network-level protection. The attack surface is broad because it affects any browser-accessible
    internal service.
  how: >-
    The attacker registers a domain with a DNS server they control. The DNS server initially
    responds with the attacker's external IP (passing any validation checks). The attacker's
    web page loads in the victim's browser. After the initial DNS TTL expires, subsequent DNS
    requests for the same domain are answered with an internal IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1,
    192.168.x.x, or 169.254.169.254). The browser, which has already accepted the domain, now
    makes requests to the internal service. Mitigation includes implementing Host header validation,
    DNS pinning, network-level DNS rebinding protection at resolvers, and requiring authentication
    on all internal services.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2025-9377 is a DNS rebinding vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass network access
    controls and access internal services by exploiting DNS resolution behavior. CVSS v3 score is
    7.5 High. Applications relying on DNS-based host validation without rebinding protections are
    vulnerable. Attackers manipulate DNS responses to first resolve externally then rebind to
    internal IPs, bypassing firewalls and same-origin policy. Enables access to internal dashboards,
    APIs, IoT devices, and cloud metadata services. Mitigation includes Host header validation, DNS
    pinning, resolver-level rebinding protection, and authentication on all internal services. Maps
