# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2011-0609 (CVSS 9.3) is a critical memory corruption vulnerability in Adobe Flash
    Player 10.2.152.33 and earlier versions. The vulnerability is triggered by processing
    specially crafted SWF content that causes memory corruption leading to arbitrary code
    execution. It was exploited as a zero-day in targeted attacks using Flash content embedded
    in Microsoft Excel files delivered via spearphishing. Also affects Adobe AIR and Flash
    Player plugin in Adobe Reader. Patched in APSB11-05 (March 2011).
  why: >-
    Flash Player's ubiquitous presence in web browsers and its embedding capability in Office
    documents and PDFs made it a prime target for APT groups. This zero-day demonstrated the
    compound attack surface where Flash exploits could be delivered through multiple vectors
    including web pages, Office documents, and PDF files. The ability to embed Flash in Excel
    files bypassed many security controls focused on web-delivered content.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability is triggered when Flash Player processes a specially crafted SWF file
    that causes an invalid memory access during ActionScript execution. The attack vector used
    in the wild embedded the malicious SWF inside an Excel (.xls) spreadsheet, which was
    delivered via spearphishing email. When the victim opens the Excel file, the embedded Flash
    content triggers the memory corruption, enabling arbitrary code execution in the context
    of the host application. Heap spraying techniques ensure reliable exploitation.

      value: "SWF content processing causes invalid memory access during ActionScript execution enabling code execution"
    - key: "Cross-Format Embedding"
      value: "Flash content embedded in Excel files creates compound exploit vector bypassing format-specific security controls"
    - key: "Zero-Day APT Weapon"
      value: "Exploited as a zero-day in targeted spearphishing campaigns before any patch was available"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2011-0609 is a critical memory corruption vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Adobe Flash
    Player 10.2 and earlier (APSB11-05). Specially crafted SWF content causes invalid memory
    access during ActionScript execution, enabling arbitrary code execution. Exploited as a
    zero-day via malicious Flash content embedded in Excel spreadsheets delivered through
    spearphishing. Demonstrates the compound attack surface of Flash embeddable in web pages,
    Office documents, and PDFs. Affects Flash Player, Adobe AIR, and Reader/Acrobat.
