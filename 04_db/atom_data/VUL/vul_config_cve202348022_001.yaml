definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-48022 is a critical server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Anyscale Ray
    open-source AI/ML framework. The Ray Dashboard API does not enforce authentication by default and
    allows unauthenticated users to submit arbitrary jobs for execution on the Ray cluster. This
    effectively provides full remote code execution to any network-accessible attacker. The vulnerability
    is disputed by Anyscale who considers the lack of authentication a design decision rather than a
    vulnerability. CVSS v3: 9.8 (Critical).
  why: >-
    Ray is one of the most widely adopted open-source AI/ML computing frameworks, used by organizations
    including OpenAI, Uber, Amazon, and Netflix for distributed computing workloads. The ShadowRay
    campaign demonstrated mass exploitation of exposed Ray clusters, compromising AI production
    workloads, stealing environment variables containing API keys and credentials, accessing training
    data and ML models, and using GPU resources for cryptomining. The vulnerability is particularly
    dangerous because Anyscale disputes it as a CVE, meaning many organizations may not treat it as
    a security issue requiring remediation.
  how: >-
    Exploitation is trivial - attackers send HTTP requests to the Ray Dashboard API (default port 8265)
    to submit arbitrary Python jobs for execution on the Ray cluster. No authentication or authorization
    is required. The Jobs API allows full code execution in the context of the Ray worker processes,
    which typically have access to sensitive data, environment variables, cloud credentials, and GPU
    resources. Attackers in the ShadowRay campaign used automated scanning to find exposed Ray
    Dashboard instances and deployed cryptominers, reverse shells, and credential stealers.
    Mitigation requires placing Ray clusters behind authentication proxies and restricting network
    access to the Dashboard API.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2023-48022 is a critical vulnerability in the Anyscale Ray open-source AI/ML framework known
    as ShadowRay. The Ray Dashboard API lacks authentication by default, allowing unauthenticated
    attackers to submit arbitrary Python jobs for execution on Ray clusters. CVSS v3 score is 9.8
    Critical. The vulnerability is disputed by Anyscale as a design decision. The ShadowRay campaign
    demonstrated mass exploitation of exposed Ray clusters, compromising AI workloads, stealing API
    keys and credentials from environment variables, accessing training data and ML models, and using
    GPU resources for cryptomining. Ray is used by major organizations including OpenAI, Uber, and
    Amazon. Mitigation requires authentication proxies and network access controls. Maps to MITRE
