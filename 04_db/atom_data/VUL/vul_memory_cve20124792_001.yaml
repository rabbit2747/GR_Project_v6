# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2012-4792 is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Microsoft Internet Explorer
    6, 7, and 8 involving the CDwnBindInfo object in mshtml.dll. The vulnerability allows remote
    code execution when a user visits a specially crafted website. It was exploited as a zero-day
    in December 2012 in a watering hole attack against the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)
    website. Microsoft issued an emergency Fix-it tool and subsequently patched it in MS13-008
    (January 2013).
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is notable for its use in a high-profile watering hole attack targeting
    the Council on Foreign Relations, a prestigious US foreign policy think tank. The attack
    demonstrated the sophistication of nation-state actors using browser zero-days against
    strategic targets. The CFR watering hole attack pattern became a widely-studied case of
    strategic web compromise for targeted espionage operations.
  how: >-
    The exploit injects malicious JavaScript into a compromised website (watering hole) that
    manipulates the IE DOM to trigger a use-after-free condition in the CDwnBindInfo object.
    The freed memory is reallocated with attacker-controlled data through heap spraying. When
    the dangling pointer to CDwnBindInfo is dereferenced, execution is redirected to the
    attacker's shellcode, achieving code execution in the context of Internet Explorer.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "CDwnBindInfo Use-After-Free"
      value: "CDwnBindInfo object in mshtml.dll is freed during DOM manipulation but dangling pointer allows code execution via heap spray"
    - key: "Strategic Watering Hole Attack"
      value: "Exploited as zero-day in watering hole attack against Council on Foreign Relations website for targeted espionage"
