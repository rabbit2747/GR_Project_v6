definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-8088 is a container escape vulnerability in container runtime configurations that
    allows a process running inside a container to break out of the container namespace and gain
    access to the underlying host operating system. The vulnerability exists in how the container
    runtime handles certain namespace operations when specific kernel capabilities are available
    to the container process. Successful exploitation provides root-level access on the container
    host. CVSS v3: 8.8 (High).
  why: >-
    Container isolation is a fundamental security boundary in modern cloud-native infrastructure.
    Container escape vulnerabilities break this boundary, allowing an attacker who has compromised
    a containerized application to access the host OS, other containers, and potentially the
    entire Kubernetes cluster. In multi-tenant environments, container escapes can lead to
    cross-tenant compromise. Container hosts typically run many containers, so a single escape
    affects all co-located workloads. This is particularly impactful in managed Kubernetes services.
  how: >-
    The attacker first gains code execution within a container (through application vulnerability
    or supply chain compromise). The attacker then exploits the vulnerability by performing
    specific namespace operations that the container runtime fails to properly restrict. When
    certain Linux capabilities (such as CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_NET_ADMIN) are available to the
    container, the attacker can manipulate namespace boundaries to escape the container isolation.
    Post-escape, the attacker has root access on the host and can access other containers,
    Kubernetes secrets, and node resources. Mitigation includes dropping unnecessary capabilities
    from containers, using seccomp profiles, running containers as non-root, and applying patches.
