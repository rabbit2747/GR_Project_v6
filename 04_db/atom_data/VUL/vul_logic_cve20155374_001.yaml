# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-5374 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in Siemens SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC
    Compact protective relay devices with the EN100 Ethernet module. Sending specially crafted
    packets to port 50000/UDP causes the device to enter a denial-of-service state requiring a
    manual restart. The firmware logic fails to properly validate or handle malformed network
    packets, causing the protection relay to become unresponsive. CVSS v2 base score: 7.8 (High).
  why: >-
    SIPROTEC devices are protection relays used in electrical substations to monitor power
    grid conditions and trip circuit breakers during fault conditions. A denial of service
    against these devices removes protective functions from electrical infrastructure, potentially
    allowing equipment damage or cascading power failures. This vulnerability was demonstrated
    in the 2016 Ukraine power grid attack context.
  how: >-
    An attacker sends specially crafted UDP packets to port 50000 on the SIPROTEC EN100 Ethernet
    module. The firmware packet processing logic fails to handle the malformed input, causing
    the device to crash into an unresponsive state. Recovery requires physical manual restart
    of the device, which in remote substation environments may take considerable time.

    CVE-2015-5374 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in Siemens SIPROTEC protection relays
    with EN100 Ethernet modules. Malformed UDP packets to port 50000 crash the device, requiring
    manual restart. SIPROTEC relays protect electrical substations by tripping circuit breakers
    during faults. DoS removes safety functions risking equipment damage and power grid
    instability. CVSS v2 7.8 High. Related to Ukraine power grid attack context. Firmware
    packet processing logic failure. Siemens ICS equipment. Year 2015.
