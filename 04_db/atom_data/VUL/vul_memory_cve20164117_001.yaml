# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2016-4117 is a type confusion vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in Adobe Flash Player that
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted Flash content. The vulnerability
    was exploited as a zero-day in May 2016 in targeted attacks before Adobe released an
    emergency patch in APSB16-15. The flaw exists in the ActionScript virtual machine where
    type confusion during object processing enables memory corruption and code execution.
    It affects Flash Player 21.0.0.226 and earlier across all platforms.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was one of the last significant Flash Player zero-days exploited in
    active targeted attacks. By May 2016, most major browsers had begun restricting Flash
    content, but the plugin remained installed on billions of systems. The continued discovery
    and exploitation of Flash zero-days reinforced the industry decision to phase out Flash
    entirely. Adobe announced in July 2017 that Flash Player would reach end of life in
    December 2020, a decision influenced by the ongoing stream of critical vulnerabilities.
  how: >-
    The exploit creates Flash content that triggers a type confusion in the ActionScript 3
    virtual machine during object property access. The type confusion causes the VM to
    interpret one object type as another, leading to memory corruption. The attacker
    leverages the confusion to craft a read/write primitive over process memory, overwriting
    function pointers or vtable entries to redirect execution to shellcode embedded in the
    Flash content.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2016-4117 is a type confusion vulnerability with CVSS 10.0 in Adobe Flash Player's
    ActionScript 3 virtual machine. Type confusion during object property access causes memory
    corruption enabling arbitrary read/write primitives and code execution through crafted
    Flash content. Exploited as a zero-day in May 2016 in targeted attacks, it was patched
    in emergency APSB16-15. Affecting Flash Player 21.0.0.226 and earlier across all platforms,
    this vulnerability was among the final wave of significant Flash zero-days that reinforced
    the industry decision to phase out Flash Player entirely. Adobe subsequently announced
    Flash end-of-life for December 2020, ending an era of Flash-based web exploitation.
