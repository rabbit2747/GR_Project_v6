# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2012-5612 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Oracle MySQL and MariaDB
    that allows authenticated remote users to cause a denial of service or potentially execute
    arbitrary code. The vulnerability exists in the way MySQL handles certain SQL statements
    involving long column names processed by the privilege checking code. The CVSS v2 base
    score is 6.5 and it was disclosed in December 2012. The flaw affects MySQL 5.5.19 and
    other versions in the 5.5.x branch.
  why: >-
    MySQL is the world's most popular open-source database and underpins countless web
    applications, content management systems, and enterprise platforms. A buffer overflow in
    the database server itself can lead to denial of service affecting all hosted databases
    or, in worst cases, code execution with the privileges of the database process. Even
    requiring authentication, this is exploitable by any user with basic database access.
  how: >-
    An authenticated attacker sends a specially crafted SQL statement containing an excessively
    long column name that triggers a heap buffer overflow in MySQL's privilege checking
    functions. The overflow corrupts heap memory, which can crash the server causing denial
    of service or potentially be leveraged for code execution through heap manipulation
    techniques. Exploitation requires only basic database authentication. Mitigation involves
    upgrading MySQL to patched versions and restricting database user privileges.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Heap Buffer Overflow"
      value: "Memory corruption on the heap caused by SQL statements with oversized column names exceeding buffer allocation"
    - key: "Authenticated Exploitation"
      value: "Vulnerability requires basic database credentials but no elevated privileges for exploitation"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2012-5612 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Oracle MySQL and MariaDB
    5.5.x that allows authenticated users to crash the database or potentially execute code.
    The flaw exists in privilege checking functions that fail to properly validate column name
    lengths in SQL statements. With CVSS score 6.5, exploitation requires only basic database
    authentication to trigger heap corruption. MySQL being the most popular open-source
    database means this vulnerability has widespread impact across web applications and
    enterprise systems. Mitigation requires upgrading to patched MySQL versions and applying
    principle of least privilege to database user accounts.
