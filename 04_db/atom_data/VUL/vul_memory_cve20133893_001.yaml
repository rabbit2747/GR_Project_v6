# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2013-3893 is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Microsoft Internet Explorer
    related to the CDisplayPointer object handling and the SetMouseCapture function in mshtml.dll.
    The vulnerability allows remote code execution when a user visits a specially crafted web page.
    It was exploited as a zero-day in September 2013 in targeted attacks attributed to the
    DeputyDog APT campaign. Microsoft issued a Fix-it workaround and patched it in MS13-080
    (October 2013). It affects IE 6 through 11.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant for its use in the DeputyDog APT campaign, which targeted
    organizations in Japan and other Asian countries. It demonstrated that even newer versions
    of Internet Explorer (including IE 11) could be compromised through use-after-free
    vulnerabilities. The wide version range affected (IE 6-11) meant virtually all IE installations
    were vulnerable, maximizing the impact of the zero-day exploitation.
  how: >-
    The exploit uses JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements and mouse capture events to trigger
    a use-after-free condition in the CDisplayPointer object. When a mouse capture is set on an
    element that is subsequently freed, the dangling pointer remains. Through heap spraying,
    the freed memory is filled with attacker-controlled data. When the dangling pointer is
    accessed during mouse event processing, execution is redirected to shellcode.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "CDisplayPointer Use-After-Free"
      value: "Mouse capture on a freed DOM element leaves a dangling CDisplayPointer enabling code execution through heap spray"
    - key: "DeputyDog APT Campaign"
      value: "Exploited as zero-day in the DeputyDog targeted attack campaign against Japanese and Asian organizations"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2013-3893 is a use-after-free vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in Microsoft Internet
    Explorer 6 through 11 involving the CDisplayPointer object and SetMouseCapture function
    in mshtml.dll. The flaw enables remote code execution through crafted web pages that
    trigger use-after-free during mouse event processing. Exploited as a zero-day in the
    DeputyDog APT campaign targeting Japanese and Asian organizations in September 2013,
    it affected virtually all IE installations. Patched in MS13-080 in October 2013, this
    vulnerability demonstrated that even newer IE versions remained susceptible to DOM
    use-after-free attacks and highlighted the continued use of browser zero-days in
    nation-state espionage operations.
