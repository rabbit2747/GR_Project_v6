# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2010-1871 is an Expression Language (EL) injection vulnerability in JBoss Seam 2
    framework that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The JBoss Seam framework
    improperly evaluates user-supplied EL expressions through the actionOutcome parameter in
    URLs, enabling injection of arbitrary Java Unified Expression Language expressions. The
    vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 6.8 and was disclosed in 2010.
  why: >-
    JBoss Seam was a widely used Java web framework for building enterprise applications on
    JBoss Application Server. Expression Language injection bypasses normal application logic
    to directly invoke Java methods on the server, providing attackers with a powerful code
    execution primitive. This vulnerability type became increasingly important as EL injection
    was later found in numerous Java frameworks including Spring and Struts.
  how: >-
    Attackers inject malicious EL expressions through the actionOutcome URL parameter in
    JBoss Seam applications. The framework evaluates these expressions server-side without
    proper sanitization, allowing attackers to call arbitrary Java methods including
    Runtime.exec() for operating system command execution. A typical exploit URL contains
    an EL expression like #{expressions} that gets evaluated by the Seam framework engine.
    Mitigation requires upgrading JBoss Seam to patched versions and implementing input
    validation to prevent EL expression injection.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2010-1871 is an Expression Language injection vulnerability in JBoss Seam 2 framework
    allowing remote code execution with CVSS score 6.8. The framework improperly evaluates
    user-supplied EL expressions through the actionOutcome URL parameter without sanitization.
    Attackers inject malicious Java Unified EL expressions to invoke arbitrary Java methods
    including system command execution via Runtime.exec(). This vulnerability was significant
    as an early example of EL injection in enterprise Java frameworks, a pattern later
    replicated in Apache Struts OGNL injection and Spring Framework SpEL injection
    vulnerabilities. Mitigation requires patching JBoss Seam and implementing strict input
    validation against EL expression patterns.
