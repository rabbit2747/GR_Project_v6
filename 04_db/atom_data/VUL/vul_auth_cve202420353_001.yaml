# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2024-20353 is a denial of service vulnerability in the management and VPN web servers of
    Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software. A remote
    unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests to cause the device to reload
    unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service condition. This vulnerability was exploited as
    part of the ArcaneDoor campaign by a sophisticated state-sponsored threat actor tracked as
    UAT4356 (Storm-1849). CVSS v3.1 score is 8.6.
  why: >-
    Cisco ASA and FTD firewalls are deployed at the network perimeter of critical infrastructure,
    government agencies, and enterprises worldwide. The ArcaneDoor campaign demonstrated that
    state-sponsored actors specifically target network edge devices as initial access vectors
    because they provide direct access to protected networks and are often less monitored than
    endpoint systems. This DoS vulnerability was used alongside CVE-2024-20359 to establish
    persistent access to compromised firewalls for espionage operations.
  how: >-
    The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to the WebVPN or management interface of
    the Cisco ASA/FTD device, triggering a crash and reload. In the ArcaneDoor campaign, this
    vulnerability was used in combination with CVE-2024-20359 (persistent local code execution)
    to deploy custom implants named Line Runner and Line Dancer on compromised firewalls.
    Mitigation includes applying Cisco security patches, disabling unnecessary web services on
    the management interface, limiting management access to trusted networks, monitoring for
    unexpected device reloads, and checking for indicators of compromise from the ArcaneDoor
    campaign.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2024-20353 is a denial of service vulnerability in Cisco ASA and Firepower Threat Defense
    web services with CVSS v3.1 score 8.6. A remote unauthenticated attacker sends crafted HTTP
    requests to the WebVPN or management interface causing the device to crash and reload. Exploited
    as part of the ArcaneDoor campaign by state-sponsored actor UAT4356/Storm-1849 to target
    government and critical infrastructure firewalls. Used alongside CVE-2024-20359 to deploy
    persistent implants named Line Runner and Line Dancer on compromised devices. Mitigation
    includes Cisco patches, disabling unnecessary web services, restricting management access,
    and monitoring for ArcaneDoor indicators of compromise.
