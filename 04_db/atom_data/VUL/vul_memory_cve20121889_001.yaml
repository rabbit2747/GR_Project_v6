# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2012-1889 is an uninitialized memory corruption vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Microsoft
    XML Core Services (MSXML) that allows remote code execution. The flaw exists in how MSXML
    accesses an object in memory that has not been properly initialized, enabling an attacker
    to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. It was exploited as a zero-day in targeted
    attacks and was patched in MS12-043 (July 2012). The vulnerability affects MSXML versions
    3.0 through 6.0 used by Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was actively exploited as a zero-day before the patch was available,
    used in both targeted attacks and mass exploitation campaigns. MSXML is a core Windows
    component used by Internet Explorer and Office, providing an exceptionally large attack
    surface. The vulnerability was integrated into exploit kits and was also used by APT
    groups for targeted spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
  how: >-
    The exploit creates a web page or document that uses JavaScript to invoke MSXML functionality
    in a way that accesses an uninitialized memory object. By manipulating the heap layout through
    spray techniques, the attacker ensures that the uninitialized memory contains attacker-
    controlled data. When MSXML accesses this memory, it treats the attacker data as a valid
    object pointer, allowing redirection of execution flow to shellcode.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Uninitialized Memory Access in MSXML"
      value: "MSXML accesses an object that was not properly initialized, allowing attacker-controlled data in uninitialized memory to redirect execution"
    - key: "Zero-Day Exploitation Across Vectors"
      value: "Exploited as zero-day through both web-based (IE) and document-based (Office) attack vectors before patch availability"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2012-1889 is an uninitialized memory corruption vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in
    Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) versions 3.0 through 6.0. The flaw allows remote
    code execution when MSXML accesses an improperly initialized memory object, which an
    attacker fills with controlled data via heap spraying. Exploited as a zero-day in both
    targeted APT attacks and mass exploitation campaigns, it affected Internet Explorer and
    Microsoft Office. Patched in MS12-043 in July 2012, this vulnerability demonstrated the
    risk of core Windows components like MSXML providing a wide attack surface exploitable
    through multiple vectors including web browsing and document opening.
