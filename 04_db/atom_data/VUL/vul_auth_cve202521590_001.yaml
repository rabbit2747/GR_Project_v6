# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2025-21590 is an improper isolation or compartmentalization vulnerability in the Juniper
    Junos OS kernel affecting multiple versions across Juniper Networks routing and switching
    platforms. The vulnerability allows a local attacker with shell access to execute arbitrary
    code by exploiting weaknesses in the kernel's process isolation mechanisms. This can lead to
    device compromise and integrity violations. CVSS v3.1 score is 4.4 (Medium). Juniper confirmed
    the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, with CISA adding it to the Known Exploited
    Vulnerabilities catalog in March 2025.
  why: >-
    Juniper Networks routers and switches form the backbone of enterprise and service provider
    networks globally. While requiring local shell access limits the attack surface, sophisticated
    threat actors who gain initial access to network infrastructure devices can leverage this
    vulnerability for privilege escalation and persistent compromise. The exploitation of Junos OS
    vulnerabilities by state-sponsored actors targeting telecommunications and critical
    infrastructure has been a growing concern, as network infrastructure devices provide strategic
    vantage points for traffic interception and espionage.
  how: >-
    A local attacker with shell access to the Junos OS device exploits improper isolation in the
    kernel to break out of process compartmentalization boundaries and execute arbitrary code with
    elevated privileges. This can be used to inject code into trusted processes, modify system
    configurations, or install persistent backdoors. Mitigation includes applying Juniper security
    patches, restricting shell access to authorized administrators only, implementing strong
    authentication for device management, monitoring for unauthorized process execution, and
    performing regular integrity checking of Junos OS system files.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2025-21590 is an improper isolation vulnerability in the Juniper Junos OS kernel with
    CVSS v3.1 score 4.4. A local attacker with shell access exploits weaknesses in kernel process
    isolation to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Affects multiple Junos OS
    versions across Juniper routing and switching platforms. Confirmed exploited in the wild with
    CISA adding it to the KEV catalog in March 2025. Juniper infrastructure forms the backbone
    of enterprise and service provider networks, making compromise valuable for traffic
    interception and espionage. Mitigation includes patching, restricting shell access, strong
    management authentication, monitoring for unauthorized processes, and regular integrity
    checking of system files.
