# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Password Reuse Pattern is a vulnerability class where users employ the same password or
    predictable variations across multiple accounts, services, or systems. This includes using
    identical passwords for corporate and personal accounts, reusing passwords across different
    internal systems, and using minor variations (appending numbers or special characters) that
    are easily guessable from a known password. This practice creates a cascading authentication
    failure where compromise of one credential enables access to multiple systems.
  why: >-
    Password reuse is one of the most pervasive authentication vulnerabilities in enterprise
    environments. When credentials from one breach are used to access other services (credential
    stuffing), the impact multiplies exponentially. Major data breaches at services like LinkedIn,
    Adobe, and Yahoo exposed billions of credential pairs that attackers use in automated stuffing
    campaigns against corporate systems. Studies consistently show that over 60% of users reuse
    passwords across services, and password reuse between personal and corporate accounts creates
    direct paths from public breaches to enterprise network compromise.
  how: >-
    Attackers exploit password reuse through credential stuffing attacks (automated testing of
    known username/password pairs from breaches against target services), password spraying with
    common reuse patterns, and lateral movement using discovered credentials across internal
    systems. Mitigation includes implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all
    services, deploying password breach detection services (like HaveIBeenPwned integration),
    enforcing unique password requirements through password policy, using password managers to
    enable unique complex passwords, implementing credential monitoring for compromised passwords,
    and educating users about password reuse risks.

      value: "Automated testing of known credential pairs from data breaches against target services, exploiting users who reuse passwords across platforms"
    - key: "Cascading Authentication Failure"
      value: "A single credential compromise cascades to multiple systems when the same password is reused, amplifying breach impact exponentially"

  embedding_text: >-
    Password Reuse Pattern is a vulnerability class where users employ the same password across
    multiple accounts and services. When credentials from one breach are tested against other
    services through credential stuffing attacks, the impact cascades across all systems sharing
    that password. Studies show over 60% of users reuse passwords, and breaches at major services
    have exposed billions of credential pairs used in automated attacks against corporate systems.
    Password reuse between personal and corporate accounts creates direct paths from public
    breaches to enterprise compromise. Mitigation includes multi-factor authentication, password
    breach detection integration, unique password enforcement, password manager adoption,
    credential monitoring, and user education about reuse risks.
