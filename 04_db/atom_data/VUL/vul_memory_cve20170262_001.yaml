# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2017-0262 is a remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS 7.8) in Microsoft Office
    caused by improper handling of Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) image files. The
    vulnerability exists in the EPS filter (EPSIMP32.FLT) used by Office to render EPS
    images embedded in documents. A type confusion vulnerability in the EPS interpreter
    allows arbitrary code execution when a user opens a document containing a malicious
    EPS image. Discovered being exploited in the wild by APT28 (Fancy Bear), it was
    patched by Microsoft in May 2017. After multiple EPS-related zero-days, Microsoft
    disabled EPS rendering in Office entirely.
  why: >-
    CVE-2017-0262 was part of a series of EPS filter vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office
    that were heavily exploited by APT groups including APT28 (Fancy Bear) and APT29.
    The repeated exploitation of the EPS filter ultimately led Microsoft to disable EPS
    rendering in Office entirely, marking a significant attack surface reduction decision.
    The vulnerability demonstrated how legacy format support (PostScript) in modern
    applications creates exploitable attack surfaces for sophisticated threat actors.
  how: >-
    The exploit embeds a malicious EPS image within an Office document. When the document
    is opened, Office invokes the EPSIMP32.FLT filter to render the EPS content. The
    malicious EPS file contains PostScript code that triggers a type confusion
    vulnerability in the EPS interpreter, allowing arbitrary memory manipulation.
    Through carefully crafted PostScript operations, the attacker achieves shellcode
    execution within the Office process context. APT28 combined this with CVE-2017-0263
    (Win32k privilege escalation) for full system compromise from a single document.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2017-0262 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office with
    CVSS 7.8, caused by a type confusion in the EPS image filter (EPSIMP32.FLT). Malicious
    PostScript embedded in Office documents triggers arbitrary code execution when rendered.
    Exploited by APT28 (Fancy Bear) in combination with Win32k privilege escalation for
    full system compromise. Part of a series of EPS zero-days that ultimately led Microsoft
    to disable EPS rendering in Office entirely, eliminating the legacy PostScript attack
    surface from modern Office applications.
