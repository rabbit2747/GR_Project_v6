# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Web Vulnerability in the information disclosure context is a category of vulnerabilities
    specific to web applications and web-facing services that expose sensitive information to
    unauthorized users. This includes server version disclosure in HTTP headers, directory
    listing exposure, source code leakage through misconfiguration, verbose error pages revealing
    stack traces and database queries, API responses containing excessive data, and improperly
    secured administrative interfaces accessible from the internet.
  why: >-
    Web applications are the primary attack surface for most organizations, and information
    disclosure from web services provides attackers with critical reconnaissance data. Exposed
    server versions reveal known vulnerabilities to target, directory listings expose application
    structure, and verbose errors reveal database schemas and internal logic. Web-based information
    disclosure is frequently automated at scale by attackers scanning the entire internet for
    specific disclosure patterns.
  how: >-
    Web information disclosure occurs through HTTP response headers revealing server technology
    and version, improperly configured directory indexing, error pages displaying stack traces
    and SQL queries, API endpoints returning excessive data beyond what the client needs,
    misconfigured CORS policies exposing data to unauthorized origins, exposed administrative
    interfaces, backup files accessible via predictable URLs, and metadata leakage through
    HTML comments, JavaScript source maps, and robots.txt entries.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Web Attack Surface"
      value: "Web applications are the primary external attack surface and information disclosure enables targeted exploitation"
    - key: "Automated Reconnaissance"
      value: "Web information disclosure patterns are automatically scanned at internet scale by attackers and search engines"
    - key: "Server Configuration Exposure"
      value: "HTTP headers, directory listings, error pages, and backup files reveal server internals to remote attackers"

  embedding_text: >-
    Web Vulnerability (information disclosure) encompasses web application and web service
    vulnerabilities that expose sensitive information. Includes server version headers, directory
    listings, verbose error pages with stack traces, excessive API responses, misconfigured CORS,
    exposed admin interfaces, backup files, and metadata leakage. Web applications are the primary
    external attack surface. Information disclosure from web services is automated at scale by
    attackers. Exposed server versions, directory structures, and error details provide critical
    reconnaissance enabling targeted exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
