# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-7450 is a remote code execution vulnerability in IBM WebSphere Application Server
    caused by unsafe Java object deserialization of data from the Apache Commons Collections
    library. The application logic deserializes untrusted data without proper validation,
    allowing an attacker to craft malicious serialized Java objects that execute arbitrary
    commands when deserialized by the server. CVSS v3 base score: 9.8 (Critical).
  why: >-
    IBM WebSphere is widely deployed in enterprise environments for hosting critical business
    applications. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution, providing
    full control over the application server. The Apache Commons Collections deserialization
    issue affected numerous Java platforms and became one of the most significant vulnerability
    classes of 2015-2016.
  how: >-
    An attacker sends a specially crafted serialized Java object to the WebSphere Application
    Server through exposed interfaces that accept serialized data. The server's deserialization
    logic processes the malicious object using vulnerable Apache Commons Collections classes,
    triggering a gadget chain that results in arbitrary command execution on the server with
    the privileges of the WebSphere process.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Unsafe Deserialization Logic"
      value: "Application deserializes untrusted input without validation, allowing attacker-controlled object instantiation and method invocation"
    - key: "Gadget Chain Exploitation"
      value: "Apache Commons Collections classes form a chain of method calls that transform deserialization into arbitrary command execution"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2015-7450 is a remote code execution vulnerability in IBM WebSphere Application Server
    via unsafe Java deserialization of Apache Commons Collections objects. Unauthenticated
    attackers send malicious serialized objects that trigger gadget chains executing arbitrary
    commands. CVSS v3 9.8 Critical. Affects enterprise WebSphere deployments. Part of the
    widespread 2015-2016 Java deserialization vulnerability class. Deserialization logic flaw
    processing untrusted input without validation. Year 2015.
