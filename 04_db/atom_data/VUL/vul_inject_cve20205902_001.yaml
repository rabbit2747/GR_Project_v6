# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-5902 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in F5 BIG-IP Traffic
    Management User Interface (TMUI) that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute
    arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, disable services, and run Java code.
    The vulnerability combines path traversal with command injection in the TMUI web
    interface. The CVSS v3 base score is 9.8 (Critical) and it was disclosed in July 2020
    with immediate mass exploitation.
  why: >-
    F5 BIG-IP devices are critical network infrastructure deployed at thousands of
    organizations for load balancing, SSL termination, and application delivery. These
    devices handle sensitive traffic and sit at the network perimeter. CISA issued an
    emergency directive requiring federal agencies to patch within days. Mass scanning and
    exploitation began within hours of disclosure.
  how: >-
    Attackers exploit path traversal in the TMUI URL to bypass authentication and access
    restricted JSP pages. The traversal uses semicolon-based path manipulation to reach
    tmshCmd.jsp and other privileged endpoints that execute system commands. Attackers can
    read sensitive files, execute arbitrary commands, and fully compromise the device.
    Mitigation requires upgrading F5 BIG-IP and restricting TMUI access to management
    networks only.
