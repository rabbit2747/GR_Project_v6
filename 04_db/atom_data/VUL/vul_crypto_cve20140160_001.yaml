# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed) is a critical buffer over-read vulnerability in OpenSSL's
    implementation of the TLS Heartbeat extension (RFC 6520) that allows an attacker to read up to
    64KB of server memory per request without authentication or logging. The vulnerability existed
    in OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f, affecting an estimated 17% of all TLS-enabled web
    servers at disclosure. CVSS score is 7.5. Disclosed in April 2014, it is considered one of the
    most impactful vulnerabilities in internet history.
  why: >-
    Heartbleed was catastrophic because it allowed unauthenticated extraction of server private keys,
    session tokens, passwords, and other sensitive data from memory with no trace in server logs.
    OpenSSL was used by the majority of TLS-enabled services on the internet, meaning the vulnerability
    affected hundreds of millions of servers, routers, and devices. The leak of private keys meant
    attackers could decrypt past and future traffic (absent perfect forward secrecy) and impersonate
    servers indefinitely.
  how: >-
    The TLS Heartbeat extension allows peers to send a HeartbeatRequest message containing a payload
    and a length field. The vulnerable OpenSSL code allocates a response buffer based on the
    attacker-specified length rather than the actual payload length, then copies that many bytes from
    memory into the response. By sending a HeartbeatRequest with a small payload but large length field
    (up to 65535 bytes), the attacker receives back the payload plus whatever data is adjacent in
    server memory, potentially including private keys, session cookies, and user credentials.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "Buffer Over-Read"
      value: "Missing bounds check allows reading beyond the intended buffer, exposing adjacent memory contents to the attacker"
    - name: "Heartbeat Extension Abuse"
      value: "The TLS Heartbeat keep-alive mechanism is exploited by mismatching the declared payload length with actual payload size"
    - name: "Server Memory Exposure"
      value: "Each exploitation attempt can leak up to 64KB of server process memory including cryptographic keys and user credentials"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2014-0160, known as Heartbleed, is a critical buffer over-read vulnerability in OpenSSL's
    implementation of the TLS Heartbeat extension. It allows unauthenticated attackers to read up
    to 64KB of server memory per request by sending a HeartbeatRequest with a small payload but
    large declared length. The vulnerable code copies memory beyond the payload buffer without
    bounds checking. Leaked memory can contain server private keys, session tokens, passwords, and
    other sensitive data. The vulnerability affected OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f, impacting an
    estimated 17 percent of TLS-enabled web servers at disclosure in April 2014. Heartbleed is
    considered one of the most impactful vulnerabilities in internet history because it enabled
    silent extraction of cryptographic keys without logging, potentially compromising all past and
    future encrypted communications. The fix involved proper bounds checking of the Heartbeat
    payload length against the actual received data size. CVSS score is 7.5.
