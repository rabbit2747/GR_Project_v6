# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Authentication Vulnerability is a broad class of security weakness affecting the mechanisms
    that verify user identity. This encompasses flaws in password-based authentication, session
    token management, multi-factor authentication implementations, certificate-based authentication,
    and federated identity systems. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to compromise passwords,
    keys, session tokens, or exploit implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
    temporarily or permanently. Ranked as OWASP Top 10 A07:2021, authentication failures are
    among the most critical web application security risks.
  why: >-
    Authentication is the first line of defense in any security architecture. When authentication
    mechanisms fail, attackers gain unauthorized access to systems, data, and services. This can
    lead to complete account takeover, unauthorized data access, lateral movement within networks,
    and full system compromise. The prevalence and impact of authentication vulnerabilities make
    them a persistent top-tier security concern across all application types.
  how: >-
    Authentication vulnerabilities arise from weak password policies, improper session management,
    missing brute-force protections, insecure credential storage, flawed multi-factor authentication
    implementations, and predictable session tokens. Exploitation involves credential stuffing,
    brute-force attacks, session hijacking, token manipulation, and authentication bypass techniques.
    Mitigation requires implementing strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, secure
    session management, account lockout mechanisms, credential hashing with salting, and continuous
    monitoring for authentication anomalies.

  embedding_text: >-
    Authentication Vulnerability is a broad class of security weakness affecting identity
    verification mechanisms including password-based, session token, multi-factor, and
    certificate-based authentication. Ranked OWASP Top 10 A07:2021, these flaws allow
    attackers to compromise credentials, hijack sessions, or bypass authentication entirely
    to assume other users identities. Attack vectors include credential stuffing, brute
    force, session fixation, token manipulation, and logic bypass. Mitigation requires
    strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, secure session management, account
    lockout mechanisms, proper credential hashing with salting, and continuous monitoring.
    Impacts include account takeover, unauthorized data access, lateral movement, and
    complete system compromise.
