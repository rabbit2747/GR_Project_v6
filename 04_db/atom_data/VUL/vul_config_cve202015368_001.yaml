definition:
  what: "CVE-2020-15368 is a vulnerability in the ASRock Polychrome RGB software's kernel driver (AsrDrv103.sys) that allows low-privileged users to read and write arbitrary Model-Specific Registers (MSRs) and physical memory through IOCTLs. The driver is signed by a legitimate certificate and loaded at the kernel level, providing ring-0 access to any user-mode process that can open a handle to the device."
  why: "This vulnerability represents the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attack pattern where threat actors install legitimately signed but vulnerable kernel drivers to gain kernel-level access. Multiple APT groups and ransomware operators have used vulnerable drivers like AsrDrv103 to disable endpoint security products, establish kernel-level persistence, and bypass driver signing enforcement. The signed nature of the driver makes it difficult to block through standard security controls."
  how: "The AsrDrv103.sys driver exposes IOCTL interfaces that allow user-mode processes to read/write arbitrary MSRs, read/write physical memory, and perform PCI configuration space operations without any access validation. An attacker installs the legitimately signed driver, opens a handle to its device, and sends IOCTL requests to read/write kernel memory, disable security features, or modify system behavior at the hardware level. This enables disabling PatchGuard, modifying kernel structures, and disabling security software."

    - key: "Arbitrary MSR/Physical Memory Access"
      value: "Kernel driver exposes interfaces allowing user-mode processes to directly read and write Model-Specific Registers and physical memory without access control"
