definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2015-1641 is a type confusion memory corruption vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Microsoft
    Word related to handling of smart tags and custom XML elements in RTF documents. The
    vulnerability allows remote code execution when a user opens a specially crafted Word
    document. It was exploited in targeted attacks and became one of the most exploited Office
    vulnerabilities alongside CVE-2012-0158. Patched in MS15-033 (April 2015), it affects
    Word 2007 through 2013 and Office for Mac 2011.
  why: >-
    CVE-2015-1641 became the successor to CVE-2012-0158 as the most commonly exploited Office
    vulnerability in targeted attacks during 2015-2017. Threat intelligence reports consistently
    ranked it among the top exploitation vectors used by both APT groups and cybercrime actors.
    The vulnerability's enduring popularity stemmed from reliable exploitation across multiple
    Word versions and the continued effectiveness of document-based spear-phishing as an
    initial access technique.
  how: >-
    The exploit crafts an RTF document containing malicious smart tag or custom XML elements
    that trigger a type confusion when Word processes the document structure. The type confusion
    causes Word to interpret an object as a different type, leading to memory corruption. The
    attacker leverages the corruption to achieve an arbitrary write primitive, which is used
    to redirect execution flow to shellcode embedded in the document.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2015-1641 is a type confusion memory corruption vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in
    Microsoft Word's smart tag and custom XML handling. Malformed smart tag elements in RTF
    documents trigger type confusion causing Word to misinterpret object types, leading to
    memory corruption and arbitrary code execution. Patched in MS15-033 in April 2015,
    affecting Word 2007-2013 and Office for Mac 2011, it became the successor to CVE-2012-0158
    as the most widely exploited Office vulnerability in targeted attacks during 2015-2017.
    Both APT groups and cybercrime actors extensively leveraged this vulnerability for
    document-based spear-phishing campaigns against enterprise targets.
