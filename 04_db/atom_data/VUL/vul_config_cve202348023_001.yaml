definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2023-48023 is a missing authentication vulnerability in the Anyscale Ray open-source AI/ML
    framework. The Ray Client API does not require authentication, allowing any user with network
    access to the Ray cluster to connect as a client and submit compute tasks. This is a companion
    vulnerability to CVE-2023-48022, affecting the Ray Client interface rather than the Dashboard API.
    The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote users to access cluster resources, read stored
    data, and execute arbitrary code. CVSS v3: 9.8 (Critical). Like CVE-2023-48022, this is disputed
    by Anyscale.
  why: >-
    The Ray Client API provides programmatic access to the full capabilities of a Ray cluster,
    including job submission, actor creation, and data access. Without authentication, any network-
    accessible attacker gains the same privileges as legitimate cluster users. This is especially
    critical in cloud environments where Ray clusters may be inadvertently exposed to the internet.
    Combined with CVE-2023-48022, it creates a situation where all Ray API surfaces lack authentication,
    making exposed clusters trivially exploitable for data theft, cryptomining, and supply chain
    attacks on ML models.
  how: >-
    Exploitation requires only network access to the Ray Client API port. An attacker connects using
    the standard Ray Python client library with ray.init() pointing to the target cluster address.
    Once connected, the attacker can submit arbitrary Python functions for remote execution, access
    the Ray object store containing shared data, create persistent actors, and consume cluster compute
    resources. No credentials or tokens are needed. Mitigation requires deploying Ray behind
    authentication-enforcing reverse proxies, network segmentation to prevent unauthorized access,
    or upgrading to Ray versions that support authentication when enabled.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2023-48023 is a critical missing authentication vulnerability in the Anyscale Ray AI/ML
    framework's Client API. The Ray Client API does not require authentication, allowing any user
    with network access to connect and submit arbitrary compute tasks, access stored data, and
    execute code on the cluster. CVSS v3 score is 9.8 Critical. Companion vulnerability to
    CVE-2023-48022 affecting the Client interface rather than the Dashboard API. Disputed by
    Anyscale as a design decision. Exploitation enables data theft, cryptomining, and ML model
    poisoning. Ray is widely used by major technology companies for distributed AI computing.
    Mitigation requires authentication proxies and network segmentation. Maps to MITRE ATT&CK
    T1190 and CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
