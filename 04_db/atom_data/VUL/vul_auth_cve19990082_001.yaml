# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-1999-0082 is a vulnerability in the CDE (Common Desktop Environment) Subprocess Control
    Service (dtspcd) on Unix and Linux systems that allows remote attackers to gain root access.
    The dtspcd service, which listens on TCP port 6112, contains an authentication bypass flaw
    that permits unauthenticated remote users to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
    This vulnerability was disclosed in 1999 and affects multiple Unix vendors including Sun
    Solaris, HP-UX, and IBM AIX systems running CDE.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability provides unauthenticated remote root access, representing the most severe
    class of security flaw. Exploitation requires no credentials and grants complete system
    control. CDE was widely deployed across enterprise Unix environments, making this vulnerability
    a significant risk to critical infrastructure systems of the era.
  how: >-
    Attackers exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the dtspcd
    service on TCP port 6112. The service fails to properly authenticate incoming requests,
    allowing remote command execution as root. Mitigation involves disabling the dtspcd service,
    filtering port 6112 at network firewalls, upgrading to patched CDE versions, or migrating
    away from CDE to modern desktop environments.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-1999-0082 is a critical vulnerability in the CDE Common Desktop Environment Subprocess
    Control Service (dtspcd) on Unix and Linux systems. The dtspcd service listening on TCP
    port 6112 contains an authentication bypass allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. Affected systems include Sun Solaris,
    HP-UX, and IBM AIX running CDE. Exploitation requires no credentials and grants complete
    system control. Mitigation involves disabling dtspcd, filtering port 6112, applying vendor
    patches, or migrating from CDE. This represents a classic unauthenticated remote code
    execution vulnerability from the late 1990s enterprise Unix era.
