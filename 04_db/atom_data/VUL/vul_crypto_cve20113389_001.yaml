# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2011-3389 (BEAST - Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) is a vulnerability in TLS 1.0 and
    earlier that allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to decrypt HTTPS cookies by exploiting a
    known weakness in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode cipher suites. The attack leverages
    predictable initialization vectors (IVs) in TLS 1.0 CBC mode where the last ciphertext
    block of a record is reused as the IV for the next record. CVSS score is 4.3. Demonstrated
    by Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo in 2011.
  why: >-
    BEAST was significant because it demonstrated a practical chosen-plaintext attack against
    TLS 1.0, which was the dominant protocol version at the time. It could extract authentication
    cookies from HTTPS sessions, enabling session hijacking. The attack motivated the industry-wide
    migration from TLS 1.0 to TLS 1.1 and later, and prompted the adoption of RC4 as a temporary
    mitigation (itself later found vulnerable).
  how: >-
    The attacker uses JavaScript or a Java applet injected into the victim's browser to generate
    chosen plaintext requests over the HTTPS connection. Because TLS 1.0 CBC mode uses the
    previous ciphertext block as the IV for the next record (which is predictable to an eavesdropper),
    the attacker can perform a blockwise chosen-boundary attack. By carefully aligning the target
    cookie at a cipher block boundary and XORing guesses with the known IV, the attacker can verify
    correct guesses by observing matching ciphertext blocks, recovering the cookie one byte at a time.

    - name: "Predictable IV in CBC"
      value: "TLS 1.0 reuses the last ciphertext block as the IV for the next record, making IVs predictable to network observers"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2011-3389, known as the BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) attack, is a vulnerability
    in TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 that allows man-in-the-middle attackers to decrypt HTTPS cookies by
    exploiting predictable initialization vectors in CBC mode cipher suites. TLS 1.0 reuses the
    last ciphertext block as the IV for the next record, which is visible to network observers.
    The attacker uses browser-injected code to generate chosen plaintext aligned at cipher block
    boundaries, then verifies guesses by comparing ciphertext blocks. Demonstrated by Thai Duong
    and Juliano Rizzo in 2011, BEAST proved practical chosen-plaintext attacks against TLS 1.0
    were feasible. The attack accelerated industry migration to TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 which use
    explicit random IVs for each record. Temporary mitigations included preferring RC4 cipher
    suites and implementing 1/n-1 record splitting to break IV predictability. BEAST remains
    historically significant as a catalyst for TLS protocol modernization.
