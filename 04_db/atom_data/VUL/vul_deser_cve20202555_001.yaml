# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-2555 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in Oracle Coherence, a distributed
    caching library bundled with Oracle WebLogic Server. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated
    remote code execution by exploiting unsafe deserialization of Java objects through Coherence's
    ValueExtractor gadget chain. An attacker sends a crafted serialized object via the T3 or IIOP
    protocol. CVSS score is 9.8. Affects Coherence versions 3.7.1.0, 12.1.3.0, and 12.2.1.4.
  why: >-
    Oracle Coherence introduced a new class of deserialization gadget chains that bypassed existing
    WebLogic serialization filters. The Coherence library is bundled with WebLogic and present on
    the default classpath, providing gadget chains even when other common libraries are filtered.
    This vulnerability spawned multiple variants and bypass chains, establishing Coherence as a
    persistent gadget source for WebLogic deserialization attacks.
  how: >-
    The attacker crafts a serialized Java object that chains through Coherence's ValueExtractor
    classes (LimitFilter, ExtractorComparator, ReflectionExtractor) to achieve method invocation
    on arbitrary objects. The payload is sent via the T3 or IIOP protocol to the WebLogic listener.
    During deserialization, the ValueExtractor chain triggers reflection-based method calls that
    ultimately execute operating system commands through Runtime.exec() or similar mechanisms.

    - name: "Coherence ValueExtractor Chain"
      value: "A novel gadget chain leveraging Coherence's LimitFilter, ExtractorComparator, and ReflectionExtractor classes"
    - name: "Bundled Library Gadgets"
      value: "Coherence is bundled with WebLogic, providing gadget chains that bypass filters targeting common libraries"
    - name: "Filter Bypass"
      value: "Coherence classes were not included in WebLogic's initial deserialization filter blocklist, enabling exploitation"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2020-2555 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in Oracle Coherence, a distributed
    caching library bundled with Oracle WebLogic Server. The vulnerability exploits a novel gadget
    chain through Coherence's ValueExtractor classes including LimitFilter, ExtractorComparator,
    and ReflectionExtractor to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. CVSS score is 9.8.
    Payloads are delivered via T3 or IIOP protocol to WebLogic listeners. Coherence classes were
    not included in WebLogic's initial deserialization filter blocklist, enabling bypass of
    existing protections. The vulnerability established Coherence as a persistent gadget source
    and spawned multiple variants. Affects Coherence versions 3.7.1.0, 12.1.3.0, and 12.2.1.4.
    Mitigation requires applying Oracle patches, implementing comprehensive serialization
    filtering that includes Coherence classes, and restricting T3/IIOP protocol access.
