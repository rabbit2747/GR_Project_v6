# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2012-4818 is an information disclosure vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere Information Server
    versions 8.1 through 8.7. The application exposes sensitive credential information through
    improper handling of authentication data, allowing remote authenticated attackers to obtain
    sensitive information such as encrypted passwords and database connection strings that could
    facilitate further attacks against the system.
  why: >-
    Information disclosure of credential material in enterprise data integration platforms like
    IBM InfoSphere is critical because these systems typically have broad access to multiple
    backend databases and data warehouses. Compromised credentials from these systems can provide
    attackers with lateral movement paths to sensitive data stores across the enterprise, making
    them high-value targets.
  how: >-
    The vulnerability exists in the way IBM InfoSphere Information Server handles and exposes
    authentication-related data. Authenticated users can access sensitive configuration data
    containing encrypted passwords and connection strings through the application interfaces.
    The exposed credential material can potentially be decrypted or reused to gain unauthorized
    access to connected database systems and data integration workflows.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Credential Exposure"
      value: "Encrypted passwords and database connection strings exposed to authenticated users through application interfaces"
    - key: "Enterprise Data Platform Risk"
      value: "Data integration servers connect to multiple databases making credential compromise a lateral movement enabler"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2012-4818 is an information disclosure vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere Information Server
    versions 8.1 through 8.7. The application improperly exposes sensitive credential data including
    encrypted passwords and database connection strings to authenticated users. Since InfoSphere
    serves as an enterprise data integration platform connecting to multiple backend databases and
    data warehouses, credential compromise provides attackers with lateral movement opportunities
    across connected data stores. The vulnerability highlights risks inherent in enterprise data
    integration platforms that maintain multiple database credentials. Discovered in 2012.
