# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-2551 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server's IIOP
    (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol) handler that allows unauthenticated remote code execution.
    An attacker can send a crafted IIOP request containing a malicious serialized Java object to
    the WebLogic IIOP listener, which deserializes it without adequate validation, triggering
    arbitrary code execution. CVSS score is 9.8. Affects WebLogic Server versions 10.3.6.0,
    12.1.3.0, 12.2.1.3, and 12.2.1.4.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability is significant because it exploits the IIOP protocol rather than HTTP,
    bypassing web application firewalls and HTTP-focused security controls. WebLogic's IIOP
    listener is often exposed on the T3 port and may be accessible when the HTTP console is
    properly firewalled. The vulnerability provided yet another deserialization attack vector
    against WebLogic, reinforcing its status as a persistent target.
  how: >-
    The attacker connects to the WebLogic IIOP listener port and sends a crafted IIOP request
    containing a serialized Java object that exploits gadget chains available on the WebLogic
    classpath. The IIOP handler deserializes the request payload without proper input validation
    or class filtering. The deserialized object triggers a chain of method calls through available
    gadget classes, ultimately executing arbitrary operating system commands on the server.
  core_concepts:
    - name: "IIOP Protocol Exploitation"
      value: "Targeting the IIOP protocol instead of HTTP bypasses web-focused security controls and WAF protection"
    - name: "Protocol-Level Deserialization"
      value: "The IIOP handler deserializes Java objects from network requests without adequate class filtering"
    - name: "Alternative Attack Surface"
      value: "IIOP provides a secondary attack surface when HTTP-based WebLogic attack vectors are mitigated"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2020-2551 is a critical deserialization vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server's IIOP
    protocol handler enabling unauthenticated remote code execution. Attackers send crafted IIOP
    requests containing malicious serialized Java objects to the WebLogic IIOP listener, which
    deserializes them without adequate validation. Gadget chains available on the WebLogic
    classpath are leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution. CVSS score is 9.8, affecting
    WebLogic Server versions 10.3.6.0 through 12.2.1.4. The IIOP protocol vector is significant
    because it bypasses web application firewalls and HTTP-focused security controls. The IIOP
    listener may remain exposed even when HTTP admin console access is properly restricted.
    Mitigation includes disabling the IIOP protocol if not required, applying Oracle patches,
    implementing network segmentation, and using Java serialization filters. This vulnerability
    reinforces WebLogic's status as a persistent deserialization attack target.
