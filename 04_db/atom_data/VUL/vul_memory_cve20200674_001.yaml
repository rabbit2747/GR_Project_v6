# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-0674 is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 7.5) in the JScript scripting
    engine used by Internet Explorer that allows remote code execution when a user visits
    a malicious webpage. The vulnerability exists in how jscript.dll handles objects in
    memory. Disclosed by Microsoft in January 2020 as an actively exploited zero-day, it
    was initially issued with only a mitigation workaround (restricting jscript.dll access)
    before a full patch was released in February 2020. The vulnerability was exploited by
    APT groups including DarkHotel in targeted watering hole attacks.
  why: >-
    CVE-2020-0674 demonstrated that legacy scripting engines like JScript continued to
    present critical attack surface in Windows even as newer browsers moved away from them.
    Internet Explorer's inclusion as a default Windows component meant all Windows systems
    were potentially vulnerable regardless of whether users actively used IE. The delayed
    patch availability (over a month of active exploitation with only mitigations) highlighted
    challenges in rapidly remediating legacy component vulnerabilities.
  how: >-
    The exploit crafts a malicious webpage containing JScript code that manipulates object
    creation and garbage collection to trigger a use-after-free in jscript.dll. When visited
    in Internet Explorer, the freed memory is reallocated with attacker-controlled data
    enabling arbitrary code execution in the browser process context. The exploit uses
    information leak techniques to bypass ASLR and builds a ROP chain to bypass DEP.
    Delivery occurs through watering hole attacks on compromised legitimate websites or
    through links in spear-phishing emails that open in Internet Explorer.

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2020-0674 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Windows JScript engine
    (jscript.dll) with CVSS 7.5 enabling remote code execution through Internet Explorer.
    Disclosed as an active zero-day in January 2020, it was exploited by DarkHotel APT
    in targeted watering hole attacks. The JScript engine's presence on all Windows systems
    created ubiquitous attack surface. The exploit manipulates object creation and garbage
    collection to trigger a use-after-free, with information leak techniques to bypass
    ASLR and ROP chains for DEP bypass. A full patch was not available until February 2020,
    over a month after active exploitation was confirmed.
