# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2020-8468 is a content validation bypass vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One and
    OfficeScan that allows an attacker to manipulate certain agent client components. The
    logic flaw in the content validation mechanism allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to
    modify component downloads during updates, potentially enabling code execution on
    endpoints managed by the security platform. CVSS v3 base score: 8.0 (High). Exploited
    in the wild as a zero-day.
  why: >-
    Trend Micro Apex One is an endpoint protection platform deployed across enterprise
    environments. Bypassing content validation of agent updates allows an attacker to deliver
    malicious components to managed endpoints through the trusted update channel. This is
    particularly impactful because security software updates are typically trusted and
    whitelisted, making this an effective supply chain attack vector.
  how: >-
    A man-in-the-middle attacker intercepts the communication between Apex One agents and
    the management server during component updates. The content validation logic insufficiently
    verifies the integrity of downloaded components, allowing the attacker to substitute
    malicious components that are then executed by the agent with elevated privileges.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Content Validation Logic Bypass"
      value: "Insufficient integrity verification of agent component downloads allows substitution of malicious updates"
    - key: "Trusted Channel Abuse"
      value: "Security software update mechanism becomes an attack vector when content validation can be bypassed"
