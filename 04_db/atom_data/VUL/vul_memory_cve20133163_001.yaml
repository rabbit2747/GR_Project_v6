# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    CVE-2013-3163 is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8,
    9, and 10 involving the CGenericElement object in mshtml.dll. The vulnerability allows remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user visits a specially crafted web page that triggers
    improper handling of objects in memory. It was exploited in targeted attacks and was patched in
    MS13-055 (July 2013). The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer on Windows Vista, 7, and 8.
  why: >-
    This vulnerability was actively exploited in targeted attacks and was also integrated into
    exploit kits for broader exploitation. Internet Explorer use-after-free vulnerabilities in
    DOM element handling remained one of the most common browser exploit classes during 2013.
    The CGenericElement flaw provided a reliable remote code execution primitive through standard
    web browsing, making it valuable for both targeted and opportunistic attacks.
  how: >-
    The exploit creates a web page with JavaScript that manipulates DOM elements to trigger a
    use-after-free condition in the CGenericElement object. Through careful heap manipulation
    using techniques like heap feng shui and spray, the freed memory is reallocated with
    attacker-controlled data. When the dangling pointer is dereferenced, execution is redirected
    to shellcode achieving arbitrary code execution.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "CGenericElement Use-After-Free"
      value: "DOM manipulation triggers use-after-free in CGenericElement object in mshtml.dll enabling code execution via heap control"
    - key: "Dual Exploitation Vector"
      value: "Used in both targeted APT attacks and mass exploitation through exploit kit integration"

  embedding_text: >-
    CVE-2013-3163 is a use-after-free vulnerability with CVSS 9.3 in Microsoft Internet
    Explorer 8, 9, and 10 affecting the CGenericElement object in mshtml.dll. The flaw
    enables remote code execution when users visit malicious web pages that trigger improper
    DOM element handling. The exploit uses heap manipulation to reallocate freed memory with
    attacker-controlled data for code execution. Exploited in both targeted attacks and
    through exploit kit integration, it was patched in MS13-055 in July 2013. This
    vulnerability was representative of the Internet Explorer DOM use-after-free class
    that remained a dominant browser attack vector throughout 2013.
