definition:
  what: >-
    KEMTLS is a redesign of the TLS 1.3 handshake protocol that replaces digital signatures
    in server authentication with Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs), proposed by Schwabe,
    Stebila, and Wiggers in 2020. Unlike standard TLS 1.3 which uses signatures in the
    CertificateVerify message for server authentication, KEMTLS authenticates the server
    implicitly through a KEM encapsulation against the server's long-term KEM public key
    embedded in its certificate. This approach eliminates the need for post-quantum signature
    schemes (which tend to have large signatures or public keys) from the handshake, relying
    exclusively on KEMs which are generally more efficient in post-quantum parameter sizes.
  why: >-
    Post-quantum digital signatures present significant challenges for TLS performance: Dilithium
    signatures are approximately 2.4 KB, FALCON signatures require complex floating-point
    arithmetic, and SPHINCS+ signatures can exceed 7 KB. These sizes substantially increase
    handshake overhead when used in CertificateVerify messages. KEMTLS addresses this by
    eliminating handshake signatures entirely, replacing them with KEM operations that are
    computationally faster and produce smaller ciphertexts. The trade-off is that KEMTLS achieves
    server authentication one round trip later than standard TLS 1.3 (after the server's Finished
    message rather than at CertificateVerify), though the variant KEMTLS-PDK (Pre-Distributed
    Keys) can recover the performance by using cached server KEM public keys.
  how: >-
    In KEMTLS, the server's certificate contains a long-term KEM public key instead of a
    signature verification key. After receiving the server's certificate, the client encapsulates
    a shared secret against the server's KEM public key and sends the resulting ciphertext.
    This KEM shared secret is incorporated into the TLS 1.3 key schedule alongside the ephemeral
    key exchange shared secret, contributing to the derivation of handshake and application
    traffic keys. The server decapsulates using its long-term KEM private key, proving possession
    of the private key corresponding to the certified public key, thus achieving implicit
    authentication. The combined key schedule ensures forward secrecy through the ephemeral
    KEM exchange and server authentication through the static KEM exchange. KEMTLS-PDK
    optimizes latency by pre-distributing server KEM public keys, enabling the client to
    perform encapsulation in the first flight.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Signature-Free Authentication"
      value: >-
        KEMTLS replaces CertificateVerify signatures with KEM encapsulation against the
        server's certified KEM public key, eliminating post-quantum signature overhead from
        the handshake while maintaining authentication guarantees.
    - key: "Implicit Authentication"
      value: >-
        Server authentication is achieved implicitly through the server's ability to
        decapsulate the client's ciphertext using its long-term private key, rather than
        explicitly through a signature over handshake transcript.
    - key: "Dual KEM Key Schedule"
      value: >-
        The TLS key schedule incorporates both an ephemeral KEM shared secret for forward
        secrecy and a static KEM shared secret against the server's long-term key for
        authentication.
    - key: "KEMTLS-PDK"
      value: >-
        A variant using pre-distributed server KEM public keys to reduce handshake latency
        by allowing the client to perform static KEM encapsulation in the initial ClientHello
        flight.

    KEMTLS is a redesign of the TLS 1.3 handshake that replaces digital signatures in server
    authentication with Key Encapsulation Mechanisms, proposed by Schwabe, Stebila, and Wiggers
    in 2020. The server's certificate contains a KEM public key rather than a signature
    verification key. The client encapsulates a shared secret against this key, and the server
    proves identity by successfully decapsulating with its private key, achieving implicit
    authentication without signatures. This eliminates the large post-quantum signature overhead
    from handshakes since KEM ciphertexts are generally more compact than post-quantum signatures.
    The TLS key schedule incorporates both ephemeral KEM shared secrets for forward secrecy
    and static KEM shared secrets for authentication. The trade-off is authentication completes
    one round trip later than standard TLS 1.3. KEMTLS-PDK mitigates this by pre-distributing
    server KEM public keys, enabling first-flight encapsulation. The protocol demonstrates
    that TLS authentication can be achieved entirely through key exchange primitives without
    relying on signature schemes.
