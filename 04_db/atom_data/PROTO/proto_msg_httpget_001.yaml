definition:
  what: >-
    HTTP GET is the primary HTTP request method defined in RFC 9110 for retrieving a representation
    of the target resource. GET requests transfer data from server to client and must be safe
    (producing no side effects on the server) and idempotent (multiple identical requests yield
    the same result). GET is the most frequently used HTTP method, accounting for the majority
    of web traffic. Parameters are passed via the URL query string. GET responses are cacheable
    by default and can include conditional request headers (If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match) for
    cache validation.
  why: >-
    HTTP GET is the most commonly exploited HTTP method in web attacks. GET requests with
    user-controlled query parameters are vectors for SQL injection, XSS (reflected), path
    traversal, and server-side request forgery. GET request URLs with sensitive data are logged
    in server logs, browser history, proxy logs, and referrer headers, creating data leakage
    risks. C2 frameworks use GET requests for beacon check-ins. Web scraping and enumeration
    rely on GET requests. Parameter tampering in GET URLs can bypass access controls. Security
    controls must validate and sanitize all GET parameters.
  how: >-
    HTTP GET operates by sending a request line containing the method, target URI (including
    query string parameters), and HTTP version, followed by request headers. The server processes
    the request, retrieves the requested resource, and returns a response with status code,
    headers, and response body. Cache control uses headers like Cache-Control, ETag, and
    Last-Modified. Conditional requests use If-None-Match (ETag comparison) and If-Modified-Since
    (date comparison) to avoid transferring unchanged resources. GET requests should never modify
    server state and must not include a request body with semantic meaning per the specification.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Safe Method"
      value: "GET is defined as safe, meaning it should not cause side effects on the server — it retrieves data without modifying resources."
    - key: "Cacheability"
      value: "GET responses are cacheable by default, controlled by Cache-Control, ETag, and Expires headers for performance optimization."
    - key: "Query String Parameters"
      value: "Data passed in the URL after the ? delimiter as key=value pairs, visible in logs and history, creating data exposure risks for sensitive information."
    - key: "Conditional GET"
      value: "Cache validation mechanism using If-None-Match/If-Modified-Since headers to receive 304 Not Modified when resources are unchanged."

    frameworks use GET for beacon check-ins. Security requires input validation and sanitization
    of all GET parameters.
