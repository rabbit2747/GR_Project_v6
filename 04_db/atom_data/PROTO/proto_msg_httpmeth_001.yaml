definition:
  what: >-
    HTTP methods (also called HTTP verbs) are the set of request methods defined in RFC 9110 that
    indicate the desired action to be performed on a target resource. The standard methods are
    GET (retrieve), HEAD (metadata only), POST (submit data), PUT (replace resource), DELETE
    (remove resource), CONNECT (establish tunnel), OPTIONS (describe communication options),
    TRACE (message loop-back), and PATCH (partial modification, RFC 5789). Methods are
    classified by safety (no side effects: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE), idempotency (same result
    for repeated calls: GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE), and cacheability (GET, HEAD).
  why: >-
    HTTP method configuration is a critical security control. Overly permissive method allowance
    exposes applications to unauthorized data modification (PUT, PATCH, DELETE), information
    disclosure (TRACE enabling cross-site tracing), and server exploitation. TRACE method
    combined with XSS enables cross-site tracing (XST) attacks. PUT method on web servers can
    enable arbitrary file upload. The OPTIONS method reveals supported methods, aiding
    reconnaissance. Method override headers (X-HTTP-Method-Override) can bypass method
    restrictions. WAF and server configurations should restrict methods to only those required.
  how: >-
    HTTP methods are specified in the request line of an HTTP message as the first token before
    the request URI. Servers process methods based on the resource type and configured handlers.
    RESTful API design maps methods to CRUD operations: POST (Create), GET (Read), PUT/PATCH
    (Update), DELETE (Delete). Method handling is configured at the web server, application
    framework, and API gateway levels. Security implementation includes: disabling unnecessary
    methods (TRACE, CONNECT, PUT), enforcing method-specific authorization, validating method
    override headers, and implementing proper CORS preflight handling for cross-origin requests.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Safe Methods"
      value: "Methods that do not modify server state (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) — safe methods should only retrieve data, never cause side effects."
    - key: "Idempotent Methods"
      value: "Methods where multiple identical requests produce the same server state as a single request (GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE) — POST and PATCH are not idempotent."
    - key: "CRUD Mapping"
      value: "RESTful convention mapping HTTP methods to data operations: POST=Create, GET=Read, PUT=Replace, PATCH=Partial Update, DELETE=Delete."
    - key: "Method Override"
      value: "Technique using X-HTTP-Method-Override header to simulate methods not supported by clients or proxies, creating potential security bypass vectors."

  embedding_text: >-
    HTTP methods (verbs) defined in RFC 9110 indicate the desired action on a target resource:
    GET (retrieve), HEAD (metadata), POST (submit), PUT (replace), DELETE (remove), CONNECT
    (tunnel), OPTIONS (describe), TRACE (loop-back), and PATCH (partial modify). Methods are
    classified by safety, idempotency, and cacheability. RESTful APIs map methods to CRUD
    operations. Security requires restricting methods to only those needed — TRACE enables XST
    attacks, PUT allows file upload, OPTIONS aids reconnaissance. Method override headers can
    bypass restrictions. WAF and server configurations should enforce method-specific
    authorization and disable unnecessary methods.
