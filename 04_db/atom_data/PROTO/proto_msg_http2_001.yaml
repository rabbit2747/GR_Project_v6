definition:
  what: >-
    HTTP/2 is the second major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, standardized in IETF
    RFC 7540 (2015, revised as RFC 9113 in 2022). Derived from Google's SPDY protocol, HTTP/2
    introduces binary framing, multiplexed streams over a single TCP connection, header
    compression via HPACK (RFC 7541), server push, and stream prioritization. Unlike HTTP/1.1's
    text-based protocol, HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer that encapsulates HTTP semantics
    (methods, headers, status codes) into frames transmitted over multiplexed streams. HTTP/2
    maintains full backward compatibility with HTTP/1.1 semantics while dramatically improving
    performance.
  why: >-
    HTTP/2 addresses critical performance limitations of HTTP/1.1 including head-of-line blocking,
    connection overhead from multiple TCP connections, and inefficient header transmission.
    However, HTTP/2 introduces new security considerations: the binary protocol format complicates
    traditional WAF and IDS inspection, multiplexed streams enable new denial-of-service vectors
    (rapid reset attack CVE-2023-44487), and HPACK header compression creates potential for
    CRIME-style side-channel attacks. Protocol downgrade attacks from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 can
    bypass security controls. Security tools must understand HTTP/2 framing for effective
    inspection.
  how: >-
    HTTP/2 operates through: (1) Connection establishment via TLS ALPN negotiation (h2) or
    cleartext upgrade (h2c); (2) Binary framing where all communication is split into frames
    (HEADERS, DATA, SETTINGS, WINDOW_UPDATE, etc.) transmitted on multiplexed streams; (3) HPACK
    header compression using static and dynamic tables to reduce header overhead; (4) Flow control
    at both connection and stream levels using WINDOW_UPDATE frames; (5) Server push allowing the
    server to proactively send resources the client will need; (6) Stream prioritization enabling
    clients to indicate resource importance. A single TCP connection carries multiple concurrent
    streams, eliminating HTTP/1.1's need for multiple parallel connections.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Binary Framing"
      value: "HTTP/2 encapsulates all messages in binary frames with type, length, flags, and stream identifier, replacing HTTP/1.1's text-based message format."
    - key: "Multiplexed Streams"
      value: "Multiple concurrent request-response exchanges over a single TCP connection, eliminating head-of-line blocking at the HTTP layer."
    - key: "HPACK Header Compression"
      value: "RFC 7541 compression algorithm using static and dynamic header tables to significantly reduce header overhead across requests."
    - key: "Server Push"
      value: "Mechanism allowing servers to proactively send resources to clients before they are explicitly requested, reducing round trips."
