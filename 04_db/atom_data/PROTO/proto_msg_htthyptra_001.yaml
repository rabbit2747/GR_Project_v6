definition:
  what: >-
    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundational application layer protocol for
    the World Wide Web, enabling communication between web clients (browsers, APIs) and servers.
    Originally defined by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 and standardized as HTTP/1.1 in RFC 2616
    (1999, revised as RFC 9110-9112 in 2022), HTTP is a stateless, text-based request-response
    protocol operating over TCP on port 80 (cleartext) or port 443 (HTTPS). HTTP defines methods
    (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), status codes (1xx-5xx), headers, and content negotiation
    mechanisms. It serves as the transport for HTML documents, APIs (REST, GraphQL), file
    downloads, streaming media, and virtually all modern web communication.
  why: >-
    HTTP is the most widely used application layer protocol on the internet and the primary attack
    surface for web application security. The vast majority of cyber attacks target HTTP-based
    services: injection attacks, cross-site scripting, CSRF, session hijacking, directory
    traversal, and server-side request forgery all exploit HTTP mechanisms. HTTP's stateless
    nature requires cookie-based session management, introducing authentication vulnerabilities.
    Unencrypted HTTP traffic is susceptible to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and
    credential theft. HTTP is also the dominant transport for C2 communications. Understanding
    HTTP is fundamental to web security, network defense, and application penetration testing.
  how: >-
    HTTP operates as a request-response protocol: (1) Client establishes TCP connection to server
    (port 80/443); (2) Client sends request with method, URI, headers, and optional body; (3)
    Server processes the request and returns a response with status code, headers, and body; (4)
    Connection may be kept alive for subsequent requests (HTTP/1.1 persistent connections) or
    closed. HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, host header
    (virtual hosting), and content negotiation. Security is provided by layering TLS underneath
    HTTP (HTTPS). Modern HTTP usage includes REST APIs with JSON payloads, WebSocket upgrade,
    and server-sent events for real-time communication.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Request-Response Model"
      value: "Client sends an HTTP request (method + URI + headers + body) and server returns an HTTP response (status code + headers + body) in a synchronous exchange."
    - key: "Statelessness"
      value: "Each HTTP request is independent — the server does not retain session state between requests, requiring cookies or tokens for session management."
    - key: "HTTP Status Codes"
      value: "Three-digit response codes indicating request outcome: 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirection, 4xx client error, 5xx server error."
    - key: "Persistent Connections"
      value: "HTTP/1.1 default behavior keeping TCP connections open for multiple request-response exchanges, reducing connection establishment overhead."
