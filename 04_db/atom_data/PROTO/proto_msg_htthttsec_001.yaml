definition:
  what: >-
    HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the encrypted version of HTTP that uses Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for web communications. Defined in
    RFC 2818, HTTPS operates on TCP port 443 and wraps standard HTTP messages within a TLS
    session. The protocol ensures that data exchanged between client and server cannot be
    eavesdropped, tampered with, or forged. HTTPS uses X.509 digital certificates issued by
    Certificate Authorities (CAs) to authenticate server identity, and optionally supports
    mutual TLS (mTLS) for client authentication. HTTPS is now the default for all major web
    browsers and is required for features like HTTP/2, Service Workers, and modern web APIs.
  why: >-
    HTTPS is the primary defense against network-level attacks on web communications. Without
    HTTPS, all HTTP traffic — including credentials, session tokens, personal data, and API
    payloads — is transmitted in plaintext, vulnerable to eavesdropping, credential theft, session
    hijacking, and man-in-the-middle modification. HTTPS adoption is enforced by browsers (mixed
    content blocking, security warnings), search engines (ranking signals), and regulatory
    frameworks (PCI DSS, GDPR). However, HTTPS does not protect against application-layer
    attacks (XSS, SQLi, CSRF). Certificate management, HSTS configuration, and TLS version
    enforcement are ongoing security requirements.
  how: >-
    HTTPS operates by: (1) Client initiates TCP connection to server port 443; (2) TLS handshake
    establishes encrypted session — server presents X.509 certificate, client validates against
    trusted CA store, key exchange establishes session keys; (3) All HTTP messages are encrypted
    within the TLS tunnel; (4) Data integrity is verified via TLS record MAC. HSTS (HTTP Strict
    Transport Security) prevents protocol downgrade by instructing browsers to only use HTTPS.
    Certificate Transparency (CT) logs enable public monitoring of certificate issuance. Let's
    Encrypt and ACME protocol have automated certificate provisioning.

  embedding_text: >-
    HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the encrypted version of HTTP using TLS to provide confidentiality,
    integrity, and server authentication for web communications. Operating on TCP port 443, HTTPS
    wraps HTTP messages within TLS sessions using X.509 certificates for identity verification.
    HTTPS is the primary defense against network eavesdropping, credential theft, and MITM
    attacks. HSTS prevents protocol downgrade. Certificate Transparency enables monitoring of
    certificate issuance. HTTPS is now the default web transport, required by browsers, search
    engines, and regulations. However, HTTPS does not protect against application-layer attacks
    like XSS, SQLi, or CSRF.
