definition:
  what: >-
    EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security) is a certificate-based
    authentication protocol defined in RFC 5216 (and updated by RFC 9190 for TLS 1.3) that uses
    mutual TLS authentication within the EAP framework. Designated as EAP Type 13, it requires
    both the client (supplicant) and the authentication server to present X.509 digital
    certificates, providing the strongest form of EAP authentication. EAP-TLS is the mandatory
    EAP method for WPA2-Enterprise and WPA3-Enterprise wireless networks as specified in IEEE
    802.1X and is widely deployed in enterprise network access control for both wired and
    wireless environments.
  why: >-
    EAP-TLS addresses the fundamental weakness of password-based network authentication by
    requiring cryptographic proof of identity through digital certificates on both sides of the
    connection. Unlike EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS which only authenticate the server with a certificate
    and rely on passwords for client authentication, EAP-TLS eliminates credential theft risks
    including phishing, brute force, and credential replay attacks. The protocol provides mutual
    authentication ensuring both the client and the network infrastructure verify each other's
    identity, preventing rogue access point attacks. Enterprise environments use EAP-TLS to
    enforce device-level authentication through machine certificates, ensuring only managed
    devices can connect to the network.
  how: >-
    EAP-TLS operates within the IEEE 802.1X port-based access control framework. The supplicant
    (client) initiates the EAP exchange with the authenticator (switch or access point), which
    relays EAP messages to the authentication server (RADIUS). Inside the EAP tunnel, a full
    TLS handshake occurs: the server presents its certificate, the client validates it against
    trusted CAs, then the client presents its own certificate for server validation. Upon
    successful mutual authentication, the TLS master secret is used to derive session keys
    (Master Session Key and Extended Master Session Key) that are passed to the authenticator
    for encrypting the data link. RFC 9190 updated EAP-TLS for TLS 1.3, leveraging its
    improved handshake with zero round-trip resumption, removing the need for explicit
    ChangeCipherSpec messages, and adding post-handshake authentication support.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Mutual Certificate Authentication"
      value: >-
        Both client and server must present valid X.509 certificates, eliminating reliance on
        passwords and providing cryptographic proof of identity for both endpoints.
    - key: "802.1X Integration"
      value: >-
        EAP-TLS operates within the IEEE 802.1X framework with three roles: supplicant (client),
        authenticator (network device), and authentication server (RADIUS), enabling port-based
        network access control.
    - key: "Session Key Derivation"
      value: >-
        The TLS handshake produces a Master Session Key (MSK) and Extended MSK that are exported
        to the authenticator to encrypt the subsequent data link layer communication.
    - key: "PKI Dependency"
      value: >-
        Deployment requires a Public Key Infrastructure to issue, distribute, and manage client
        and server certificates, including certificate revocation checking via CRL or OCSP.

    EAP-TLS is a certificate-based network authentication protocol defined in RFC 5216 that
    performs mutual TLS authentication within the Extensible Authentication Protocol framework.
    As EAP Type 13, it requires both client and server to present X.509 digital certificates,
    providing the strongest EAP authentication method and eliminating password-based credential
    risks. Operating within IEEE 802.1X port-based access control, EAP-TLS involves three
    roles: the supplicant client, the authenticator network device, and the RADIUS authentication
    server. A full TLS handshake occurs inside the EAP tunnel, producing session keys that
    encrypt the data link. EAP-TLS is mandatory for WPA2-Enterprise and WPA3-Enterprise
    wireless security. RFC 9190 updated the protocol for TLS 1.3, adding zero round-trip
    resumption and post-handshake authentication. Deployment requires Public Key Infrastructure
    for certificate lifecycle management including issuance, distribution, and revocation
    checking via CRL or OCSP.
