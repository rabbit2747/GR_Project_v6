definition:
  what: >-
    Google Talk was a messaging and voice-over-IP service launched by Google in 2005 that used
    the XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, formerly Jabber) open standard for
    instant messaging and presence information. The service operated on talk.google.com using
    XMPP client-to-server connections on port 5222 with TLS encryption, and supported federation
    with other XMPP servers enabling cross-platform messaging. Google Talk was replaced by Google
    Hangouts in 2013, which subsequently transitioned to Google Chat, abandoning XMPP federation.
    The protocol remains relevant as a historical example of open protocol adoption and subsequent
    proprietary transition by a major platform.
  why: >-
    Google Talk's XMPP-based architecture is significant from a security perspective because XMPP
    remains widely used in messaging applications, IoT device communication, and has been
    documented as a C2 communication channel by threat actors. Understanding XMPP-based protocols
    is important for detecting covert communication channels, analyzing legacy messaging
    infrastructure still present in some enterprise environments, and understanding how open
    protocol federation creates cross-organizational attack paths. The transition from open XMPP
    to proprietary protocols also illustrates security implications of protocol governance changes.
  how: >-
    Google Talk operated using standard XMPP protocol with Google-specific extensions: (1) Client
    authentication via OAuth 2.0 or legacy Google credentials over TLS on port 5222; (2) Presence
    management broadcasting online/offline/away status to contacts; (3) Message exchange using
    XMPP message stanzas with end-to-end delivery via Google's XMPP servers; (4) Voice calls
    using Jingle (XEP-0166) for session negotiation and ICE/STUN/TURN for NAT traversal with
    RTP media streams; (5) Server-to-server federation using XMPP S2S protocol on port 5269
    enabling interoperability with external XMPP domains.
