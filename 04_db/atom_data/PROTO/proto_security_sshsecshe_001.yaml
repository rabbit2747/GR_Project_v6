# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    SSH Secure Shell is the overarching protocol category encompassing all versions and
    implementations of the Secure Shell cryptographic network protocol for secure remote
    access, file transfer, and network tunneling. The category includes SSH-1 (the original
    1995 protocol by Tatu Ylonen, now deprecated due to cryptographic weaknesses), SSH-2
    (the IETF-standardized version in RFC 4251-4254 that is the current standard), and various
    implementation-specific extensions including OpenSSH extensions for certificate authentication,
    FIDO2/U2F hardware key support, and post-quantum key exchange. As a protocol category,
    SSH Secure Shell represents the complete ecosystem of secure remote access protocols that
    replaced plaintext predecessors like Telnet, rlogin, and rsh.
  why: >-
    The SSH Secure Shell category exists to provide a unified reference for the family of
    protocols, implementations, and extensions that constitute the secure remote access
    ecosystem. While SSH-2 (the specific protocol) defines the wire format and cryptographic
    operations, the broader SSH Secure Shell category encompasses implementation choices
    (OpenSSH, PuTTY, Dropbear, libssh), operational patterns (key management, certificate
    authorities, jump hosts), and evolving extensions (FIDO2 keys, post-quantum algorithms).
    Understanding the full SSH ecosystem is essential for security architecture because SSH
    represents one of the largest deployed authentication and encryption systems, with SSH
    keys often providing privileged access to critical infrastructure.
  how: >-
    The SSH Secure Shell ecosystem operates through multiple layers: (1) Protocol Standards -
    RFC 4251-4254 defining the SSH-2 architecture, transport, authentication, and connection
    protocols; (2) Implementations - OpenSSH (dominant on Unix/Linux/macOS/Windows), PuTTY
    (Windows GUI client), Dropbear (embedded systems), and libssh/libssh2 (programming
    libraries); (3) Key Management - generation (ssh-keygen), distribution (ssh-copy-id,
    authorized_keys), and lifecycle management per NIST IR 7966; (4) Extensions - OpenSSH
    certificates (ssh-keygen -s), FIDO2/U2F hardware authenticator support (sk-ssh-ed25519),
    jump/proxy command chaining, and agent forwarding; (5) File Transfer - SFTP (SSH File
    Transfer Protocol, RFC 4254 subsystem) and SCP (Secure Copy Protocol); (6) Configuration
    Management - sshd_config for server hardening, ssh_config for client defaults, and
    Match blocks for conditional configuration.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "SSH-1 vs SSH-2"
      value: >-
        SSH-1 (1995) used a single monolithic protocol with known cryptographic weaknesses
        including CRC-32 integrity checks. SSH-2 (RFC 4251, 2006) redesigned the architecture
        into three layered protocols with modern cryptographic primitives.
    - key: "Implementation Ecosystem"
      value: >-
        OpenSSH is the dominant implementation maintained by the OpenBSD project. Other
        implementations include PuTTY for Windows, Dropbear for embedded systems, and
        libssh/libssh2 as programming libraries.
    - key: "SSH Key Management Lifecycle"
      value: >-
        Enterprise SSH deployments require key generation, secure distribution, authorized_keys
        management, periodic rotation, and orphaned key remediation as defined in NIST IR 7966.
    - key: "OpenSSH Certificate Authority"
      value: >-
        OpenSSH supports its own certificate format (not X.509) allowing centralized CA-based
        authentication without distributing individual public keys to every server.

    SSH Secure Shell is the overarching protocol category for all versions and implementations
    of the Secure Shell cryptographic network protocol. It encompasses SSH-1 (1995, deprecated),
    SSH-2 (RFC 4251-4254, current standard), and implementation-specific extensions. The
    ecosystem includes OpenSSH as the dominant implementation on Unix/Linux/macOS/Windows,
    PuTTY for Windows, Dropbear for embedded systems, and libssh programming libraries. Key
    management involves generation, distribution via authorized_keys, certificate authorities
    using OpenSSH's own format, and FIDO2/U2F hardware authenticator support. File transfer
    uses SFTP and SCP subsystems. Created by Tatu Ylonen in 1995 to replace insecure plaintext
    Telnet and rlogin, SSH became one of the largest deployed authentication and encryption
    systems. NIST IR 7966 provides enterprise SSH key management guidance. The category
    represents the complete secure remote access ecosystem including protocol standards,
    implementations, operational patterns, and evolving extensions for post-quantum
    cryptography.
