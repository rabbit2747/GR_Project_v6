definition:
  what: >-
    HTTP POST is a standard HTTP request method defined in RFC 9110 for submitting data to be
    processed by the target resource. POST is the primary method for form submissions, API data
    creation, file uploads, and any operation that modifies server state. POST is neither safe
    nor idempotent — each request may produce different results and side effects. Request data
    is transmitted in the message body with Content-Type headers specifying the encoding format
    (application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, application/json). In RESTful
    design, POST maps to the Create operation in CRUD patterns.
  why: >-
    HTTP POST is one of the most security-critical HTTP methods as it handles authentication
    credentials, user input, file uploads, and data modifications. POST requests are primary
    vectors for injection attacks (SQL, command, LDAP), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), file
    upload exploitation, and API abuse. POST body data, while not visible in URLs, is still
    transmitted in plaintext without HTTPS. C2 frameworks use POST for data exfiltration and
    command response submission. Rate limiting, input validation, CSRF tokens, and content type
    validation are essential security controls for POST endpoints.
  how: >-
    HTTP POST operates by sending a request with the POST method, Content-Type header indicating
    body encoding, Content-Length header specifying body size, and the request body containing
    the data payload. Common content types include: application/x-www-form-urlencoded (HTML
    form default), multipart/form-data (file uploads), and application/json (API payloads).
    The server processes the body according to the content type, validates input, performs the
    requested operation, and returns a response — typically 201 (Created) with a Location header
    for new resources, or 200 (OK) for processing results.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Non-Idempotent"
      value: "POST is not idempotent — repeated identical requests may create duplicate resources or trigger multiple operations, requiring deduplication strategies."
    - key: "Content-Type Encoding"
      value: "POST body encoding specified by Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded for forms, multipart/form-data for files, application/json for APIs."
    - key: "CSRF Protection"
      value: "POST requests require CSRF tokens or SameSite cookies to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks that exploit automatic cookie transmission."
    - key: "File Upload"
      value: "POST with multipart/form-data enables file uploads, requiring server-side validation of file types, sizes, and content to prevent malicious file execution."

  embedding_text: >-
    HTTP POST defined in RFC 9110 is the primary HTTP method for submitting data to servers,
    handling form submissions, file uploads, API data creation, and state-changing operations.
    POST is neither safe nor idempotent. Request data is transmitted in the message body with
    Content-Type encoding (form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, JSON). POST is one of the most
    security-critical HTTP methods — it is a primary vector for injection attacks, CSRF, file
    upload exploitation, and API abuse. C2 frameworks use POST for data exfiltration. Essential
    security controls include CSRF tokens, input validation, content type enforcement, and rate
    limiting.
