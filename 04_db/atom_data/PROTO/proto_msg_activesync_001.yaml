definition:
  what: >-
    ActiveSync (Exchange ActiveSync, EAS) is a Microsoft proprietary synchronization protocol
    that enables mobile devices to synchronize email, calendar, contacts, tasks, and notes with
    a Microsoft Exchange Server or compatible mail server. Operating over HTTP/HTTPS on port 443,
    EAS uses a binary XML (WBXML) encoding format for efficient data transfer over mobile networks.
    First introduced with Exchange Server 2003, the protocol supports push email notification via
    long-lived HTTPS connections, remote device wipe, device policy enforcement, and selective
    folder synchronization. EAS is licensed to third-party vendors and is supported across iOS,
    Android, and Windows Mobile platforms.
  why: >-
    ActiveSync is a critical enterprise mobile communication protocol that exposes Exchange
    mailbox data to mobile endpoints. From a security perspective, EAS is a high-value attack
    surface because it provides authenticated access to corporate email and PIM data over the
    internet. Credential stuffing, password spray attacks, and brute-force attempts frequently
    target EAS endpoints. Compromised EAS sessions allow attackers to exfiltrate email, deploy
    device policies, or trigger remote wipes. Organizations must enforce conditional access
    policies, certificate-based authentication, and device compliance checks on EAS connections.
  how: >-
    ActiveSync operates as an HTTP-based protocol where the client sends HTTPS POST requests to
    the /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync endpoint on the Exchange server. Communication uses WBXML
    binary encoding to minimize bandwidth. The synchronization process follows a folder sync,
    then item sync pattern using sync keys to track state. Push email is implemented via the Ping
    command, which maintains a long-lived HTTPS connection that the server uses to notify the
    client of new items. Device provisioning enforces organizational policies including PIN
    requirements, encryption mandates, and remote wipe capabilities through the Provision command.

    - key: "WBXML Encoding"
      value: "Binary XML format used by ActiveSync to compress synchronization payloads for efficient transmission over mobile networks with limited bandwidth."
    - key: "Sync Key"
      value: "State token exchanged between client and server to track synchronization progress and enable incremental data transfers rather than full downloads."
    - key: "Push Email (Ping Command)"
      value: "Long-lived HTTPS connection maintained by the client that allows the server to immediately notify the device when new email arrives, reducing polling overhead."
    - key: "Remote Wipe"
      value: "Server-initiated command that erases all data on a registered mobile device, used when devices are lost, stolen, or when an employee leaves the organization."

  embedding_text: >-
    ActiveSync (Exchange ActiveSync, EAS) is a Microsoft proprietary protocol for synchronizing
    email, calendar, contacts, and tasks between mobile devices and Exchange Server. Operating
    over HTTPS using WBXML binary encoding, EAS provides push email via long-lived Ping
    connections, remote device wipe capabilities, and policy-based device management. The protocol
    sends POST requests to /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync endpoints and uses sync keys for
    incremental state tracking. As a primary mobile access vector to corporate email, ActiveSync
    is a significant attack surface targeted by credential stuffing and password spray attacks.
    Security controls include certificate-based authentication, conditional access policies, and
    device compliance enforcement. Supported across iOS, Android, and Windows platforms, EAS
    remains a core enterprise mobile communication protocol.
