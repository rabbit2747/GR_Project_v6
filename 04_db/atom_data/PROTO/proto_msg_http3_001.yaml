definition:
  what: >-
    HTTP/3 is the third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, standardized in IETF
    RFC 9114 (June 2022). HTTP/3 replaces TCP with QUIC (RFC 9000) as its transport protocol,
    using UDP-based multiplexed connections with built-in TLS 1.3 encryption. This eliminates
    TCP head-of-line blocking that affected HTTP/2, provides 0-RTT connection establishment for
    resumed sessions, and uses QPACK (RFC 9204) for header compression. HTTP/3 maintains the
    same HTTP semantics (methods, headers, status codes) as HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 while
    fundamentally changing the transport layer for improved performance and resilience.
  why: >-
    HTTP/3's use of QUIC over UDP introduces significant changes for network security monitoring.
    Traditional TCP-based network inspection tools and middleboxes cannot parse QUIC traffic,
    reducing visibility into encrypted web communications. QUIC's encryption of transport headers
    prevents passive network monitoring of connection metadata. The UDP-based transport may bypass
    firewall rules designed for TCP-based HTTP. Connection migration across network changes
    complicates IP-based tracking. Security teams must update DPI capabilities, firewall policies,
    and monitoring infrastructure to account for QUIC-based HTTP/3 traffic.
  how: >-
    HTTP/3 operates by: (1) Connection establishment using QUIC handshake with integrated TLS 1.3,
    achieving 1-RTT for new connections and 0-RTT for resumed sessions; (2) Multiplexed streams
    over independent QUIC streams, eliminating head-of-line blocking since stream loss does not
    affect other streams; (3) Header compression using QPACK (RFC 9204), adapted from HPACK for
    QUIC's out-of-order delivery; (4) Connection migration using connection IDs rather than IP
    addresses, maintaining sessions across network changes; (5) Alt-Svc header or DNS HTTPS
    record for HTTP/3 service discovery. Server implementations advertise HTTP/3 availability
    through HTTP Alternative Services.

    HTTP/3 (RFC 9114) is the third major version of HTTP, replacing TCP with QUIC (RFC 9000)
    as its transport protocol. Using UDP with built-in TLS 1.3 encryption, HTTP/3 eliminates

    compression. Connection migration via connection IDs enables seamless network transitions.
    HTTP/3 maintains the same HTTP semantics as prior versions. Security implications include
    reduced network visibility due to QUIC encryption, UDP-based traffic bypassing TCP firewall
    rules, and connection migration complicating IP-based monitoring. Security teams must update
    DPI and monitoring infrastructure for QUIC-based traffic.
