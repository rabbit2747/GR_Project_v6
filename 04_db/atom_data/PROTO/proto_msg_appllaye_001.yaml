definition:
  what: >-
    An application layer protocol is a communications protocol operating at Layer 7 of the OSI
    model, providing process-to-process communication services directly to end-user applications.
    These protocols define the rules, syntax, semantics, and synchronization of data exchange
    between software applications across a network. The application layer sits above the transport
    layer (TCP/UDP) in both the OSI and TCP/IP models. Common application layer protocols include
    HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SNMP, MQTT, RDP, and SMB. Each protocol specifies message formats,
    request-response patterns, error handling, and session management appropriate to its domain.
  why: >-
    Application layer protocols are the primary interface through which users and applications
    interact with network services, making them the most exposed attack surface in any networked
    environment. Attackers exploit application layer protocols for initial access, command and
    control, data exfiltration, and lateral movement. Understanding these protocols is essential
    for network security monitoring, firewall rule configuration, intrusion detection signature
    development, and secure application design. MITRE ATT&CK technique T1071 documents adversary
    abuse of application layer protocols to blend malicious traffic with legitimate communications.
  how: >-
    Application layer protocols operate by establishing communication sessions between client
    and server processes using the underlying transport layer (typically TCP or UDP). The protocol
    defines message structure (headers, body, encoding), interaction patterns (request-response,
    publish-subscribe, streaming), state management (stateless vs. stateful), authentication
    mechanisms, and error handling procedures. Implementations use well-known port numbers
    (HTTP/80, HTTPS/443, FTP/21, SMTP/25, DNS/53) for service discovery. Modern application
    protocols increasingly use TLS encryption, binary encoding formats, and multiplexed
    connections for security and performance.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "OSI Layer 7"
      value: "The topmost layer of the OSI model where application-specific communication protocols provide services directly to end-user software processes."
    - key: "Request-Response Pattern"
      value: "The most common interaction model where a client sends a request and the server returns a response, used by HTTP, FTP, and SMTP among others."
    - key: "Well-Known Ports"
      value: "Standardized port numbers (0-1023) assigned by IANA to specific application layer protocols for consistent service discovery across networks."
    - key: "Protocol Encapsulation"
      value: "Application layer data is encapsulated within transport layer segments, which are in turn encapsulated in network layer packets for transmission."

    Application layer protocols operate at Layer 7 of the OSI model, providing process-to-process
    communication services directly to end-user applications. These protocols define message
    formats, interaction patterns, authentication mechanisms, and error handling for network
    communication. Common examples include HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SNMP, MQTT, RDP, and SMB,
    each using well-known port numbers for service discovery. Application layer protocols
    represent the most exposed attack surface in networked environments, documented in MITRE
    ATT&CK T1071 as a vector for adversary command and control, data exfiltration, and lateral
    movement. Modern implementations increasingly use TLS encryption, binary encoding, and
    multiplexed connections for security and performance.
