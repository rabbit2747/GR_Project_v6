# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol family that provides
    confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for communications over computer networks.
    TLS is the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and encompasses versions 1.0 through
    1.3, with TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246) and TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446) being the currently supported versions.
    The protocol operates between the transport layer and application layer, providing
    transparent security for upper-layer protocols including HTTPS, SMTPS, IMAPS, FTPS, and
    any TCP-based protocol. TLS is the most widely deployed cryptographic protocol on the
    internet, securing the majority of web traffic, email communication, API calls, and
    database connections. The protocol architecture comprises the handshake protocol for
    authentication and key exchange, the record protocol for data encryption and integrity,
    and the alert protocol for error notification.
  why: >-
    Internet communication protocols (HTTP, SMTP, FTP) were designed without encryption,
    transmitting data in plaintext vulnerable to eavesdropping, tampering, and impersonation.
    TLS addresses this fundamental gap by providing a standardized, interoperable encryption
    layer that application protocols can leverage without modification to their core logic.
    The protocol enables secure e-commerce, online banking, confidential communications, and
    privacy-preserving web browsing. The migration from HTTP to HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) was
    accelerated by browser indicators marking HTTP as insecure, Let's Encrypt providing free
    certificates, and search engine ranking signals favoring HTTPS. TLS is required by virtually
    all security compliance frameworks including PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, and GDPR for
    protecting data in transit. The protocol's certificate-based authentication via the X.509
    PKI system enables verification of server identity, preventing impersonation attacks.
  how: >-
    TLS operates through two primary sub-protocols: the handshake protocol and the record
    protocol. The handshake protocol authenticates peers and establishes cryptographic
    parameters through a multi-message exchange: ClientHello proposes cipher suites and
    extensions, ServerHello selects parameters, certificates provide identity proof, key
    exchange (ECDHE, DHE) derives shared secrets, and Finished messages verify handshake
    integrity. In TLS 1.3, this completes in one round trip; in TLS 1.2, it requires two.
    The record protocol then fragments application data into records (max 16KB), encrypts
    each record using the negotiated AEAD cipher (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305), and
    transmits them with record-layer headers containing content type, version, and length.
    The key schedule derives handshake and application traffic keys from the shared secret
    using HKDF (TLS 1.3) or a custom PRF (TLS 1.2). Session resumption via PSK or session
    tickets allows abbreviated handshakes for repeat connections. Certificate validation
    involves chain building to a trusted root CA, revocation checking (OCSP, CRL), and
    optional certificate transparency verification.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Handshake Protocol"
      value: >-
        The multi-message exchange that authenticates communicating parties, negotiates
        cryptographic parameters, and establishes shared keying material through key
        exchange algorithms.
    - key: "Record Protocol"
      value: >-
        The data transport sub-protocol that fragments, encrypts, and authenticates
        application data using the keys and algorithms established during the handshake.
    - key: "X.509 Certificate Authentication"
      value: >-
        TLS uses X.509 digital certificates issued by Certificate Authorities to verify
        server (and optionally client) identity, with chain validation to trusted root CAs.
    - key: "Forward Secrecy"
      value: >-
        Ephemeral key exchange (ECDHE, DHE) ensures that compromise of long-term private
        keys cannot decrypt previously recorded sessions, protecting past communications.
    - key: "AEAD Encryption"
      value: >-
        Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data provides integrated confidentiality
        and integrity in a single cryptographic operation, used in all modern TLS cipher suites.
    - key: "Protocol Version Evolution"
      value: >-
        SSL 2.0/3.0 (deprecated) established the foundation; TLS 1.0/1.1 (deprecated)
        standardized improvements; TLS 1.2 added AEAD and configurable hashing; TLS 1.3
        redesigned the handshake for 1-RTT and mandatory forward secrecy.

    Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol family providing confidentiality,
    integrity, and authentication for network communications. Encompassing versions from SSL
    through TLS 1.3, it operates between the transport and application layers to transparently
    secure HTTPS, SMTPS, IMAPS, and all TCP-based protocols. The architecture comprises the
    handshake protocol for authentication and key exchange via X.509 certificates and (EC)DHE,
    the record protocol for AEAD encryption of application data, and the alert protocol for
    error notification. TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246) introduced AEAD cipher suites and remains the
    minimum compliance standard. TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446) redesigned the handshake for 1-RTT
    latency and mandatory forward secrecy. The protocol is required by PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2,
    and GDPR for protecting data in transit. Certificate validation involves chain building to
    trusted root CAs, revocation checking via OCSP/CRL, and certificate transparency
    verification. TLS is the most widely deployed cryptographic protocol securing the majority
    of internet traffic.
