definition:
  what: >-
    HTTP DELETE is one of the standard HTTP request methods defined in RFC 9110 that requests the
    origin server to remove the association between the target resource and its current
    functionality. A successful DELETE operation typically returns 200 (OK) with a response body,
    204 (No Content) without a body, or 202 (Accepted) for asynchronous deletion. DELETE is
    idempotent — multiple identical DELETE requests should have the same effect as a single
    request. In RESTful API design, DELETE maps to the destroy/remove operation in CRUD
    (Create, Read, Update, Delete) patterns.
  why: >-
    The HTTP DELETE method is a security-sensitive operation that, when improperly secured, can
    lead to unauthorized data deletion, resource destruction, and denial of service. APIs exposing
    DELETE endpoints without proper authentication and authorization enable attackers to remove
    critical data. Mass DELETE operations can be weaponized for data destruction attacks.
    Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities combined with DELETE methods allow
    attackers to delete resources belonging to other users. WAF and API gateway configurations
    should enforce strict access controls on DELETE operations.
  how: >-
    HTTP DELETE operates by sending a request with the DELETE method to the target resource URI.
    The server validates the request against authentication credentials, authorization policies,
    and resource existence before performing the deletion. Implementation patterns include:
    soft delete (marking resources as deleted without physical removal), hard delete (permanent
    removal), and cascading delete (removing dependent resources). Proper implementation requires
    authentication verification, authorization checking, audit logging of deletion operations,
    and confirmation mechanisms for irreversible deletions.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Idempotency"
      value: "Multiple identical DELETE requests produce the same server state as a single request — the resource is removed regardless of how many times DELETE is called."
    - key: "Soft Delete vs. Hard Delete"
      value: "Soft delete marks resources as deleted while retaining data for recovery; hard delete permanently removes data from storage."
    - key: "CRUD Mapping"
      value: "In RESTful API design, DELETE maps to the 'Delete' operation, removing the resource identified by the request URI."

  embedding_text: >-
    HTTP DELETE is a standard HTTP method defined in RFC 9110 that requests removal of the target
    resource from the origin server. DELETE is idempotent and maps to the destroy operation in
    RESTful CRUD patterns. Successful responses use status codes 200, 204, or 202. DELETE is a
    security-sensitive operation requiring proper authentication and authorization enforcement.
    Improperly secured DELETE endpoints enable unauthorized data deletion, IDOR-based attacks on
    other users' resources, and data destruction denial of service. Implementation should include
    authentication verification, authorization checking, audit logging, and consideration of soft
    delete versus hard delete patterns.
