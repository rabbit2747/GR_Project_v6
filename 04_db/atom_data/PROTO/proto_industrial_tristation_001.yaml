definition:
  what: >-
    TriStation is a proprietary communication protocol used by Schneider Electric's Triconex
    Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers for engineering workstation communication,
    program download, diagnostics, and configuration. TriStation operates over UDP port 1502
    using a custom binary protocol for communication between the TriStation 1131 engineering
    software and Triconex safety controllers (Tricon, Trident, Tri-GP). The protocol enables
    uploading and downloading safety logic programs, reading and writing safety controller
    memory, changing controller operating modes (run, program, halt), and performing diagnostics.
    TriStation is an undocumented, proprietary protocol not intended for third-party
    implementation.
  why: >-
    TriStation gained global attention as the target of the TRITON/TRISIS malware (December 2017),
    the first known cyberattack specifically designed to target Safety Instrumented Systems.
    TRITON exploited the unauthenticated TriStation protocol to reprogram Triconex safety
    controllers at a Saudi Arabian petrochemical facility, attempting to disable safety logic
    that protects human life and physical assets from hazardous conditions (explosions, toxic
    releases, equipment destruction). The attack was attributed to a Russian government research
    institution (CNIIHM/TsNIIKhM). TriStation's lack of authentication means any device with
    network access can send commands to safety controllers, including downloading modified safety
    programs, changing operating modes, and reading proprietary safety logic. Compromising a SIS
    can enable physical destruction of industrial processes by disabling the safety interlocks
    designed to prevent catastrophic events.
  how: >-
    TriStation communicates using a proprietary binary protocol over UDP port 1502: (1) the
    engineering workstation initiates a session with the safety controller; (2) commands are
    sent as binary-encoded function requests including program download, memory read/write,
    mode change, and diagnostics; (3) the controller executes commands without verifying the
    source's identity or authorization; (4) the TRITON attack chain involved: gaining IT network
    access, pivoting to the OT/SIS network, reverse-engineering the TriStation protocol from
    TriStation 1131 software libraries, crafting custom TriStation messages to download
    malicious safety logic replacement programs to the Triconex controller, and attempting to
    disable safety functions while maintaining the appearance of normal operation. Security
    controls include: strict network isolation of SIS networks from both IT and basic process
    control networks, hardware key switches on Triconex controllers set to RUN mode (preventing
    remote program downloads), physical access controls for engineering workstations, monitoring
    for TriStation protocol traffic on SIS network segments, applying Schneider Electric's
    firmware updates enabling TriStation protocol authentication, and implementing IEC 62443
    zone/conduit architecture for SIS.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "TRITON/TRISIS Malware"
      value: >-
        The first known malware targeting a Safety Instrumented System, discovered in December
        2017 at a Saudi petrochemical facility. TRITON reverse-engineered the proprietary
        TriStation protocol to reprogram Triconex safety controllers, attempting to disable
        safety logic protecting against catastrophic industrial events.
    - key: "Safety Instrumented System (SIS)"
      value: >-
        An independent safety system designed to bring a process to a safe state when
        predetermined hazardous conditions are detected. SIS controllers (like Triconex) are
        the last line of defense preventing industrial catastrophes and are designed to
        operate independently of basic process control systems.
    - key: "Hardware Key Switch"
      value: >-
        A physical switch on Triconex controllers that controls the operating mode. When set
        to RUN, the controller rejects remote program download requests over TriStation,
        providing a hardware-enforced security control against unauthorized logic modification.
    - key: "SIS Network Isolation"
      value: >-
        The critical security architecture requirement to physically or logically isolate
        Safety Instrumented System networks from both IT networks and basic process control
        networks, ensuring that compromise of control systems does not provide a path to
        safety system manipulation.

    TriStation is a proprietary protocol used by Schneider Electric Triconex Safety Instrumented
    System controllers for engineering communication over UDP port 1502. It gained global attention
    as the target of TRITON/TRISIS malware (2017), the first cyberattack specifically targeting
    safety systems protecting human life in industrial environments. The attack exploited
    TriStation's unauthenticated protocol to reprogram safety logic at a Saudi petrochemical
    facility. TriStation lacks authentication, allowing any network-accessible device to download
    programs, change operating modes, and read safety logic. Security controls include strict SIS
    network isolation, hardware key switches preventing remote program downloads, physical access
    controls, monitoring for TriStation traffic, firmware updates enabling authentication, and
    IEC 62443 zone/conduit architecture. Compromise of SIS can enable physical destruction by
    disabling safety interlocks.
