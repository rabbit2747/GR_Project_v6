definition:
  what: >-
    TLS 1.0 (Transport Layer Security version 1.0) is a deprecated cryptographic protocol
    defined in RFC 2246 (January 1999) that was the first IETF-standardized version of the
    Transport Layer Security protocol, directly derived from Netscape's SSL 3.0. TLS 1.0
    introduced incremental improvements over SSL 3.0 including HMAC-based message authentication
    (replacing SSL's custom MAC construction), a more precise alert protocol, and mandatory
    support for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. TLS 1.0 was formally deprecated by RFC 8996
    (March 2021) due to cryptographic weaknesses including vulnerability to the BEAST attack
    (CVE-2011-3389) and reliance on outdated cipher suites. PCI DSS prohibited TLS 1.0 after
    June 30, 2018.
  why: >-
    TLS 1.0 was created to standardize and improve SSL 3.0 through the IETF process, addressing
    known SSL design issues while maintaining broad compatibility. The IETF standardization
    ensured vendor-neutral governance and open review. However, TLS 1.0 inherited much of
    SSL 3.0's architecture including the MAC-then-encrypt construction for CBC cipher suites
    and predictable IV generation, creating vulnerabilities that later attacks exploited. The
    BEAST attack (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) demonstrated that TLS 1.0's predictable
    CBC initialization vectors (using the previous record's ciphertext as the next IV) allowed
    chosen-plaintext attacks to decrypt session cookies. RFC 8996 formally deprecated TLS 1.0
    (and 1.1) citing these weaknesses and the availability of TLS 1.2 and 1.3.
  how: >-
    TLS 1.0 used the same handshake structure as SSL 3.0: ClientHello/ServerHello negotiation,
    certificate exchange, key exchange (RSA, DHE_RSA, DHE_DSS), ChangeCipherSpec, and Finished
    verification. Key improvements over SSL 3.0 included HMAC replacing the custom PRF-based
    MAC, the PRF using a combination of MD5 and SHA-1 for key derivation, and verification
    data in the Finished message covering the full handshake transcript. The record protocol
    supported cipher suites including TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA and
    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA. CBC mode used the previous ciphertext block as the
    IV for the next record, creating the predictable IV vulnerability. The protocol version
    was identified as {3,1} in the record header (major version 3, minor version 1, following
    SSL 3.0's {3,0}).
  core_concepts:
    - key: "IETF Standardization of SSL"
      value: >-
        TLS 1.0 was the first IETF-standardized version, transitioning the protocol from
        Netscape proprietary control to open standards governance while maintaining backward
        compatibility with SSL 3.0.
    - key: "BEAST Vulnerability"
      value: >-
        CVE-2011-3389 exploited TLS 1.0's predictable CBC initialization vectors (chained
        from previous record ciphertext) to perform chosen-plaintext attacks, enabling
        decryption of HTTP session cookies.
    - key: "HMAC Introduction"
      value: >-
        TLS 1.0 replaced SSL 3.0's custom MAC construction with standard HMAC (RFC 2104),
        providing a provably secure message authentication mechanism.
    - key: "Deprecated by RFC 8996"
      value: >-
        RFC 8996 (March 2021) formally deprecated TLS 1.0 due to cryptographic weaknesses,
        and PCI DSS prohibited its use for payment card processing after June 2018.

    TLS 1.0 is a deprecated cryptographic protocol defined in RFC 2246 (1999) that was the
    first IETF-standardized version of Transport Layer Security, directly derived from SSL 3.0.
    It introduced HMAC-based message authentication replacing SSL's custom MAC, improved alert
    protocol precision, and mandatory Diffie-Hellman support. TLS 1.0 was vulnerable to the
    BEAST attack (CVE-2011-3389) which exploited predictable CBC initialization vectors chained
    from previous record ciphertext to perform chosen-plaintext attacks against session cookies.
    The protocol inherited SSL 3.0's MAC-then-encrypt construction for CBC suites. RFC 8996
    formally deprecated TLS 1.0 in March 2021, and PCI DSS prohibited its use after June 2018.
    The protocol version is identified as {3,1} in TLS record headers. TLS 1.0 used a PRF
    combining MD5 and SHA-1 for key derivation. Its standardization transitioned the protocol
    from Netscape proprietary control to open IETF governance.
