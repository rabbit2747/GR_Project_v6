# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Post-Quantum TLS refers to TLS protocol configurations that use exclusively post-quantum
    cryptographic algorithms for key exchange and digital signatures, providing resistance
    against attacks from cryptographically relevant quantum computers. Based on NIST's
    post-quantum cryptography standardization (FIPS 203 ML-KEM for key encapsulation, FIPS 204
    ML-DSA/Dilithium for digital signatures, FIPS 205 SLH-DSA/SPHINCS+ for stateless hash-based
    signatures), Post-Quantum TLS replaces classical ECDH/RSA key exchange with lattice-based
    KEMs and classical RSA/ECDSA signatures with lattice-based or hash-based signature schemes.
    This represents the end-state cryptographic migration beyond the transitional hybrid
    approaches currently deployed.
  why: >-
    Shor's algorithm running on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer can efficiently solve
    the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems underlying RSA, Diffie-Hellman,
    and elliptic curve cryptography, breaking all currently deployed TLS key exchange and
    authentication mechanisms. The National Security Memorandum NSM-10 (May 2022) and NIST's
    post-quantum standards mandate migration to quantum-resistant algorithms. While hybrid
    approaches (combining classical and PQ algorithms) provide transitional protection,
    Post-Quantum TLS represents the target end-state where all cryptographic operations use
    quantum-resistant primitives. The harvest-now-decrypt-later threat means adversaries may
    already be collecting encrypted traffic for future quantum decryption, making migration
    urgent for long-lived secrets.
  how: >-
    Post-Quantum TLS replaces the key exchange mechanism with ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based
    Key-Encapsulation Mechanism, FIPS 203) at security levels 1, 3, or 5 (ML-KEM-512,
    ML-KEM-768, ML-KEM-1024). The client sends a KEM public key in the key_share extension,
    the server encapsulates a shared secret and returns the ciphertext, and both derive
    handshake keys via HKDF. For authentication, server certificates use ML-DSA (FIPS 204)
    or SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) signatures in the CertificateVerify message, with corresponding
    public keys in X.509 certificates. The TLS 1.3 key schedule remains unchanged; only
    the cryptographic primitives within key_share and signature operations are replaced.
    Challenges include increased handshake sizes (ML-KEM-768 adds ~1 KB, ML-DSA-65 signatures
    are ~3.3 KB) and potential fragmentation issues requiring careful MTU and TCP segment
    handling.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "ML-KEM Key Exchange"
      value: >-
        Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (FIPS 203) replaces ECDH/DHE key
        exchange in TLS, providing IND-CCA2 security against both classical and quantum
        adversaries through the hardness of the Module Learning With Errors problem.
    - key: "ML-DSA Authentication"
      value: >-
        Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (FIPS 204, based on Dilithium)
        replaces RSA/ECDSA signatures in CertificateVerify and certificate chains, providing
        EUF-CMA security against quantum attacks.
    - key: "NIST PQC Standards"
      value: >-
        NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA), and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA) provide the
        standardized post-quantum algorithms selected through the multi-year PQC
        standardization process initiated in 2016.
    - key: "Handshake Size Impact"
      value: >-
        Post-quantum algorithms significantly increase TLS handshake sizes compared to
        classical algorithms, requiring careful handling of packet fragmentation, TCP
        segmentation, and potentially multiple round trips for large certificate chains.

    Post-Quantum TLS uses exclusively post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for key exchange
    and authentication, providing resistance against quantum computer attacks. Based on NIST
    standards FIPS 203 (ML-KEM for key encapsulation), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA for digital signatures),
    and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA for hash-based signatures), it replaces classical ECDH and RSA
    primitives with lattice-based and hash-based constructions. ML-KEM replaces ECDH in the
    TLS 1.3 key_share extension, while ML-DSA replaces ECDSA/RSA in CertificateVerify messages
    and certificate chains. Post-Quantum TLS represents the end-state migration beyond
    transitional hybrid approaches that combine classical and PQ algorithms. Challenges include
    increased handshake sizes with ML-KEM adding approximately 1 KB and ML-DSA signatures
    reaching 3.3 KB. National Security Memorandum NSM-10 mandates migration to quantum-resistant
    algorithms. The harvest-now-decrypt-later threat drives urgency as adversaries may record
    encrypted traffic for future quantum decryption.
