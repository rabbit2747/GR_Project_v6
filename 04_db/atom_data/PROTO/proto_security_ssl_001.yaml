definition:
  what: >-
    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a deprecated cryptographic protocol originally developed by
    Netscape Communications in 1994-1996 to provide encrypted communication between web browsers
    and servers. SSL 2.0 (1995) was the first publicly released version, followed by SSL 3.0
    (1996, RFC 6101) which substantially redesigned the protocol. SSL 3.0 served as the direct
    basis for TLS 1.0 (RFC 2246, 1999), which is its standardized successor. All SSL versions
    have been deprecated: SSL 2.0 was prohibited by RFC 6176 (2011) and SSL 3.0 was deprecated
    by RFC 7568 (2015) following the POODLE attack (CVE-2014-3566). Despite deprecation, the
    term "SSL" persists colloquially as a generic reference to TLS-encrypted connections,
    SSL certificates, and SSL/TLS libraries.
  why: >-
    SSL was created to address the fundamental lack of encryption on the World Wide Web, where
    HTTP transmitted all data including passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information
    in plaintext. Netscape developed SSL to enable secure e-commerce by providing confidentiality,
    integrity, and server authentication for web connections. SSL's design innovations including
    the handshake protocol, certificate-based authentication, and record layer encryption
    established the architectural foundation that all subsequent TLS versions inherit. The
    protocol's deprecation was driven by discovered cryptographic weaknesses: SSL 2.0 had
    fundamental design flaws including the use of MD5 for message authentication and vulnerability
    to truncation attacks; SSL 3.0 was vulnerable to the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded
    Legacy Encryption) attack exploiting its CBC padding scheme, and used the weak RC4 cipher
    and non-AEAD MAC-then-encrypt construction.
  how: >-
    SSL 3.0 operated through a four-phase handshake: (1) ClientHello/ServerHello exchange
    negotiating cipher suite and protocol version; (2) server authentication via X.509
    certificate and optional ServerKeyExchange; (3) client key exchange via RSA-encrypted
    pre-master secret or Diffie-Hellman parameters; (4) ChangeCipherSpec activation and
    Finished message verification. The record protocol fragmented, optionally compressed,
    applied MAC (using HMAC with MD5 or SHA-1), encrypted (using RC4, DES, 3DES, or AES),
    and transmitted application data. SSL 3.0's MAC-then-encrypt construction (apply MAC
    first, then encrypt including MAC) created the vulnerability exploited by POODLE, as
    the padding bytes were not covered by the MAC. TLS 1.0 modified this by including the
    sequence number in the MAC computation and making other incremental improvements, while
    retaining the overall SSL 3.0 architecture.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Historical Foundation of TLS"
      value: >-
        SSL 3.0's architecture including the handshake protocol, record layer, alert protocol,
        and change cipher spec became the direct foundation for TLS 1.0 and all subsequent
        TLS versions.
    - key: "POODLE Attack"
      value: >-
        CVE-2014-3566 exploited SSL 3.0's non-deterministic CBC padding to decrypt encrypted
        data one byte at a time through a padding oracle, leading to SSL 3.0's formal
        deprecation in RFC 7568.
    - key: "MAC-then-Encrypt Weakness"
      value: >-
        SSL 3.0 applied the MAC before encryption but did not protect the padding bytes,
        creating a fundamental vulnerability that was partially addressed in TLS 1.0 and
        fully resolved in TLS 1.3 with mandatory AEAD ciphers.
    - key: "Colloquial Persistence"
      value: >-
        Despite complete deprecation, the term SSL persists in common usage for TLS
        connections (SSL certificate, SSL/TLS), in library names (OpenSSL), and in
        configuration parameters across web servers and applications.

    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a deprecated cryptographic protocol developed by Netscape
    in 1994-1996 that provided the first widely deployed encrypted web communication. SSL 2.0
    (1995) and SSL 3.0 (1996, RFC 6101) established the handshake, record layer, and
    certificate authentication architecture that all TLS versions inherit. SSL 3.0 served as
    the direct basis for TLS 1.0. All SSL versions are deprecated: SSL 2.0 was prohibited by
    RFC 6176 due to fundamental design flaws, and SSL 3.0 was deprecated by RFC 7568 following
    the POODLE attack (CVE-2014-3566) which exploited its non-deterministic CBC padding to
    decrypt data through a padding oracle. SSL 3.0 used MAC-then-encrypt construction without
    padding protection, RC4 cipher support, and non-AEAD modes. Despite complete deprecation,
    the term SSL persists colloquially for TLS connections, in library names like OpenSSL, and
    in configuration parameters. SSL was created to enable secure e-commerce by encrypting
    HTTP traffic that previously transmitted credentials and financial data in plaintext.
