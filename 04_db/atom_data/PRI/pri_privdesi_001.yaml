# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Privacy by Design is a systems engineering framework originally developed by Dr. Ann Cavoukian,
    former Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada, in the 1990s. It mandates that
    privacy and data protection be embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems, business
    practices, and networked infrastructure from inception rather than added as an afterthought.
    The principle was adopted as a foundational requirement under Article 25 of the EU General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR) and codified in ISO 31700:2023. It comprises seven foundational
    principles: proactive not reactive, privacy as the default setting, privacy embedded into design,
    full functionality with positive-sum outcomes, end-to-end security across the full lifecycle,
    visibility and transparency, and respect for user privacy.
  why: >-
    Privacy by Design is essential because reactive approaches to privacy protection consistently
    fail to prevent data breaches, regulatory violations, and erosion of user trust. Organizations
    that treat privacy as a bolt-on feature face exponentially higher remediation costs, regulatory
    penalties under GDPR (up to 4% of global annual turnover), and reputational damage. Embedding
    privacy proactively reduces the attack surface for personal data exposure, ensures regulatory
    compliance across jurisdictions (GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, PIPA), and builds user confidence. It is
    a legal obligation under GDPR Article 25 for any organization processing EU personal data.
  how: >-
    Implementation requires conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) during system
    design phases, applying data minimization principles to collect only necessary personal data,
    implementing pseudonymization and anonymization techniques, enforcing purpose limitation through
    technical controls, building consent management mechanisms into user interfaces, applying
    encryption for data at rest and in transit, implementing automated data retention and deletion
    policies, designing granular access controls for personal data, conducting regular privacy audits,
    and maintaining Records of Processing Activities (ROPA) as required by GDPR Article 30.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Seven Foundational Principles"
      value: >-
        Cavoukian's seven principles: (1) Proactive not Reactive, (2) Privacy as Default,
        (3) Privacy Embedded into Design, (4) Full Functionality (positive-sum), (5) End-to-End
        Security, (6) Visibility and Transparency, (7) Respect for User Privacy.
    - key: "Data Minimization"
      value: >-
        Collect and process only the minimum personal data strictly necessary for the specified
        purpose, reducing exposure risk and storage obligations under GDPR Article 5(1)(c).
    - key: "Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)"
      value: >-
        Systematic assessment required under GDPR Article 35 to identify and mitigate privacy
        risks before processing activities begin, particularly for high-risk operations involving
        large-scale personal data processing.
    - key: "Purpose Limitation"
      value: >-
        Personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not
        further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes, as mandated by GDPR
        Article 5(1)(b).
    - key: "Pseudonymization and Anonymization"
      value: >-
        Technical measures that transform personal data so it can no longer be attributed to a
        specific data subject without additional information, reducing risk while preserving data
        utility for analytics and research.
    - key: "Privacy as Default Setting"
      value: >-
        Systems must be configured to provide maximum privacy protection by default without
        requiring user action, ensuring that only data necessary for each specific purpose
        is processed.

    Privacy by Design is a foundational information governance principle developed by Dr. Ann
    Cavoukian requiring that privacy protections be embedded into the design and architecture
    of information systems and business practices from the outset. It comprises seven foundational
    principles: proactive not reactive measures, privacy as the default setting, privacy embedded
    into design, full functionality through positive-sum approaches, end-to-end security throughout
    the data lifecycle, visibility and transparency of operations, and respect for user privacy.
    The principle became a legal requirement under GDPR Article 25, mandating data protection by
    design and by default for all organizations processing EU personal data. ISO 31700 further
    standardized the approach. Implementation involves Data Protection Impact Assessments, data
    minimization, pseudonymization, purpose limitation controls, consent management, encryption,
    automated retention policies, and regular privacy audits. The principle applies across all
    system layers and security zones, requiring organizations to proactively prevent privacy
    violations rather than reactively address them after occurrence.
