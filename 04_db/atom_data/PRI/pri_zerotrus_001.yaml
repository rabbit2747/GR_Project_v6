# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Zero Trust is a cybersecurity paradigm that eliminates implicit trust from network
    architecture, requiring continuous verification of every user, device, and network flow
    regardless of location relative to the network perimeter. Originally conceptualized by
    John Kindervag at Forrester Research in 2010, the model is formally defined in NIST SP
    800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture, August 2020) as an evolving set of cybersecurity
    paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to a focus on users,
    assets, and resources. The core tenet is "never trust, always verify" - no actor, system,
    network, or service operating outside or within the security perimeter is trusted by default.
    Every access request must be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated against
    dynamic policy before granting access to applications and data. Google's BeyondCorp
    implementation (2014) demonstrated the first large-scale enterprise Zero Trust deployment.
  why: >-
    Traditional perimeter-based security models operate on the flawed assumption that everything
    inside the network boundary is trustworthy. This model fails against modern threats including
    lateral movement by advanced persistent threats (APTs), insider threats, compromised credentials,
    and the dissolution of network perimeters through cloud adoption, remote work, BYOD, and IoT
    proliferation. The 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack demonstrated that perimeter defenses
    alone are insufficient when attackers establish trusted positions inside networks. US Executive
    Order 14028 (May 2021) mandated federal agencies to adopt Zero Trust architecture, and
    CISA's Zero Trust Maturity Model provides the implementation roadmap. Zero Trust reduces
    blast radius of breaches through microsegmentation, prevents lateral movement through
    continuous verification, and provides granular visibility into all network activity.
  how: >-
    Implementation follows the five pillars defined in CISA's Zero Trust Maturity Model:
    (1) Identity - deploy strong multi-factor authentication (MFA), implement identity governance
    with continuous validation, use risk-based conditional access policies, and establish
    privileged access management (PAM); (2) Devices - maintain comprehensive device inventory,
    enforce device health and compliance checks, implement endpoint detection and response (EDR),
    and ensure device attestation before granting access; (3) Networks - implement microsegmentation
    to isolate workloads, encrypt all traffic (east-west and north-south), deploy software-defined
    perimeters (SDP), and eliminate implicit trust zones; (4) Applications and Workloads - implement
    application-level access controls, integrate security into CI/CD pipelines, deploy runtime
    application self-protection (RASP), and authorize at the application layer; (5) Data - classify
    and tag all data, implement data loss prevention (DLP), encrypt data at rest and in transit,
    and enforce data access policies based on user context, device posture, and data sensitivity.
    A Policy Decision Point (PDP) and Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) architecture governs all
    access decisions based on real-time context and risk signals.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Never Trust, Always Verify"
      value: >-
        The foundational tenet stating that no entity - whether user, device, application, or
        network flow - receives implicit trust regardless of network location. Every access
        request must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before granting access.
    - key: "Least Privilege Access"
      value: >-
        Users and systems receive only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their
        specific function, with just-in-time (JIT) and just-enough-access (JEA) provisioning
        to minimize the attack surface and potential blast radius of compromise.
    - key: "Microsegmentation"
      value: >-
        Division of the network into granular security zones that isolate workloads and
        resources, preventing lateral movement by requiring separate authentication and
        authorization for each segment boundary crossing.
    - key: "Continuous Verification"
      value: >-
        Ongoing assessment of user identity, device health, behavioral patterns, and
        environmental context throughout the duration of a session, not just at initial
        authentication. Session trust levels are dynamically adjusted based on risk signals.
    - key: "Assume Breach"
      value: >-
        Operational posture that assumes adversaries have already compromised the environment.
        Security controls are designed to detect, contain, and minimize the impact of breaches
        through microsegmentation, continuous monitoring, and automated response.
    - key: "Policy Decision Point / Policy Enforcement Point (PDP/PEP)"
      value: >-
        Architectural components defined in NIST SP 800-207 where the PDP evaluates access
        requests against policy using identity, device, and environmental context, and the PEP
        enforces the resulting allow/deny decision at the access point.
    - key: "CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model"
      value: >-
        Framework defining maturity levels (Traditional, Initial, Advanced, Optimal) across five
        pillars (Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications, Data) with cross-cutting capabilities
        including visibility, automation, and governance.

    Zero Trust is a cybersecurity paradigm that eliminates implicit trust from all network
    interactions, requiring continuous verification of every user, device, and data flow
    regardless of network location. Originated by John Kindervag at Forrester Research in 2010
    and formally defined in NIST SP 800-207, the core tenet is never trust, always verify.
    The architecture replaces traditional perimeter-based security with identity-centric,
    context-aware access controls enforced through Policy Decision Points and Policy Enforcement
    Points. Implementation follows CISA's Zero Trust Maturity Model across five pillars:
    identity with strong MFA and privileged access management, devices with health attestation
    and EDR, networks with microsegmentation and encrypted east-west traffic, applications with
    runtime protection and CI/CD security integration, and data with classification, DLP, and
    encryption. US Executive Order 14028 mandated federal Zero Trust adoption. Google's BeyondCorp
    demonstrated the first enterprise-scale implementation. The assume breach posture drives
    design of controls that detect and contain adversaries who have already penetrated defenses,
    preventing lateral movement through granular segmentation and continuous session evaluation.
    Zero Trust addresses the fundamental inadequacy of perimeter security against modern threats
    including APTs, insider threats, and cloud-era architecture dissolution.
