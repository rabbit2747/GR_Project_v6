# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Zero Trust Pillars define the five foundational domains across which Zero Trust principles
    must be systematically applied: Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications and Workloads, and
    Data. As established by the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model and aligned with NIST SP 800-207,
    each pillar represents a distinct security domain requiring independent verification,
    continuous monitoring, and least-privilege enforcement. Three cross-cutting capabilities —
    Visibility and Analytics, Automation and Orchestration, and Governance — span all five
    pillars. The pillars provide a structured framework for organizations to assess maturity,
    plan implementation roadmaps, and ensure comprehensive coverage of Zero Trust controls
    across the entire technology stack.
  why: >-
    Zero Trust cannot be achieved by securing only one domain. Attackers exploit the weakest
    link, so all five pillars must be addressed to eliminate implicit trust across the
    environment. The pillar framework prevents organizations from adopting a fragmented approach
    by providing a holistic structure that ensures no domain is overlooked. Each pillar
    represents a potential attack surface that, if left unaddressed, undermines the entire
    Zero Trust posture regardless of investments in other areas.
  how: >-
    Organizations assess their current maturity level across each pillar using the CISA maturity
    model (Traditional, Initial, Advanced, Optimal), identify gaps, and develop prioritized
    implementation roadmaps. Each pillar requires specific technical controls: Identity demands
    strong authentication and identity governance; Devices requires endpoint health verification
    and compliance enforcement; Networks mandates micro-segmentation and encrypted communications;
    Applications and Workloads needs secure development practices and runtime protection; Data
    requires classification, encryption, and access control. The three cross-cutting capabilities
    provide the supporting functions: Visibility and Analytics enables continuous monitoring,
    Automation and Orchestration enables rapid response, and Governance ensures policy compliance
    across all pillars.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Identity Pillar"
      value: "Verification of all users and non-person entities through strong authentication (MFA), identity governance, risk-based conditional access, and continuous identity validation throughout sessions."
    - key: "Devices Pillar"
      value: "Assessment and enforcement of device health, compliance posture, and security configuration before and during access to resources, including endpoint detection and response (EDR) integration."
    - key: "Networks Pillar"
      value: "Micro-segmentation, encrypted communications, software-defined perimeters, and network traffic inspection to eliminate implicit trust based on network location or connectivity."
    - key: "Applications and Workloads Pillar"
      value: "Secure application development, runtime protection, workload isolation, API security, and continuous vulnerability management for all applications and compute workloads."
    - key: "Data Pillar"
      value: "Data classification, encryption at rest and in transit, granular access controls, data loss prevention, and continuous monitoring of data access patterns and anomalies."
    - key: "Cross-Cutting Capabilities"
      value: "Visibility and Analytics, Automation and Orchestration, and Governance that span all five pillars and enable coordinated Zero Trust enforcement across the entire environment."

    Zero Trust Pillars define the five foundational security domains that must be addressed
    to achieve a comprehensive Zero Trust architecture: Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications
    and Workloads, and Data. Established by the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model and aligned with
    NIST SP 800-207, each pillar represents an independent verification domain requiring its
    own set of security controls, monitoring capabilities, and least-privilege enforcement
    mechanisms. The Identity pillar focuses on strong authentication and identity governance.
    The Devices pillar addresses endpoint health and compliance verification. The Networks
    pillar mandates micro-segmentation and encrypted communications. The Applications and
    Workloads pillar covers secure development and runtime protection. The Data pillar requires
    classification, encryption, and granular access controls. Three cross-cutting capabilities —
    Visibility and Analytics, Automation and Orchestration, and Governance — span all five
    pillars. Organizations use this framework to assess maturity levels from Traditional through
    Optimal, identify gaps, and build prioritized Zero Trust implementation roadmaps ensuring
    no domain is left unprotected.
