# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    The Zero Trust Principle is the core security axiom stating that no entity — whether user,
    device, application, or network flow — should be implicitly trusted regardless of its
    location, ownership, or prior authentication status. Formalized by NIST SP 800-207 and
    rooted in John Kindervag's 2010 Forrester research, this principle mandates three
    foundational tenets: verify explicitly (authenticate and authorize every access request
    based on all available data points), use least-privilege access (limit access to the
    minimum necessary with just-in-time and just-enough-access controls), and assume breach
    (minimize blast radius, segment access, verify end-to-end encryption, and use analytics
    for threat detection and response).
  why: >-
    Traditional network security models that grant implicit trust based on network location
    have been systematically defeated by modern attacks including insider threats, compromised
    credentials, lateral movement, and supply chain attacks. The dissolution of the traditional
    perimeter through cloud adoption, remote work, and BYOD policies renders perimeter-based
    trust models fundamentally inadequate. The Zero Trust Principle addresses these failures
    by eliminating implicit trust entirely, requiring continuous verification that adapts to
    evolving threat conditions and organizational risk posture.
  how: >-
    Implementation follows the three tenets: (1) Verify Explicitly by collecting and evaluating
    signals including user identity, location, device health, service or workload classification,
    data classification, and anomaly detection before every access decision; (2) Use Least
    Privilege Access by enforcing just-in-time (JIT) and just-enough-access (JEA) policies,
    risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection controls to limit exposure;
    (3) Assume Breach by segmenting network, user, device, and application access,
    encrypting all sessions end-to-end, and using analytics to drive threat detection,
    improve defenses, and accelerate incident response. A Policy Decision Point (PDP) and
    Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) architecture is deployed to evaluate and enforce access
    decisions in real time.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Verify Explicitly"
      value: "Every access request must be authenticated and authorized based on all available data points including identity, location, device health, data classification, and behavioral anomalies."
    - key: "Least Privilege Access"
      value: "Access is limited to the minimum permissions necessary to complete a task, enforced through just-in-time (JIT) provisioning, just-enough-access (JEA), and risk-based adaptive policies."
    - key: "Assume Breach"
      value: "Design and operate as if the environment is already compromised. Minimize blast radius through segmentation, enforce end-to-end encryption, and use analytics to detect and respond to threats."
    - key: "Elimination of Implicit Trust"
      value: "No entity receives trust based on network location, IP address, ownership, or prior successful authentication. Trust must be continuously earned and verified through real-time signals."
    - key: "Policy Decision Point (PDP)"
      value: "The logical component that evaluates access requests against policies using identity, context, and risk signals to make allow, deny, or step-up authentication decisions."
    - key: "Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)"
      value: "The enforcement component positioned inline with data flows that executes the access decisions made by the PDP, enabling or blocking resource access in real time."
    - key: "Continuous Evaluation"
      value: "Access decisions are not one-time events. Sessions and permissions are continuously re-evaluated based on changing risk signals, with access revoked when conditions change."

    The Zero Trust Principle is the foundational security axiom that no entity should be
    implicitly trusted regardless of its location, ownership, or prior authentication status.
    Formalized in NIST SP 800-207 and originating from John Kindervag's 2010 Forrester
    research, this principle is expressed through three core tenets. Verify Explicitly requires
    authenticating and authorizing every access request based on all available data points
    including user identity, device health, location, data sensitivity, and behavioral
    anomalies. Least Privilege Access limits permissions to the minimum necessary using
    just-in-time and just-enough-access controls with risk-based adaptive policies. Assume
    Breach directs organizations to operate as if their environment is already compromised,
    minimizing blast radius through micro-segmentation, enforcing end-to-end encryption,
    and employing analytics for continuous threat detection. Implementation relies on a
    Policy Decision Point and Policy Enforcement Point architecture that evaluates and
    enforces access decisions in real time. The principle eliminates the traditional
    perimeter-based trust model that has been systematically defeated by insider threats,
    credential compromise, lateral movement, and supply chain attacks in modern environments.
