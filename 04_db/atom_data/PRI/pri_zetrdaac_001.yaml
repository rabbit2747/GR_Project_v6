# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Zero Trust Data Access is a security principle that applies Zero Trust tenets specifically to data
    protection and access control, requiring that every data access request is explicitly verified,
    authorized based on real-time context, and governed by least-privilege policies regardless of the
    requester's network location or identity. It mandates continuous evaluation of data classification,
    user context, device posture, and environmental risk signals before granting access to any data
    resource. As defined in NIST SP 800-207 and CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model, data is treated as
    the primary asset to protect, with access decisions enforced at the data layer rather than solely
    at the network perimeter.
  why: >-
    Traditional perimeter-based access controls fail to protect data once an attacker or insider
    breaches the network boundary. Data is the ultimate target of most cyberattacks, making
    data-centric access controls essential. Without Zero Trust Data Access, organizations face
    risks of unauthorized data exfiltration, lateral movement exploiting implicit trust, and
    regulatory non-compliance with frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS that mandate
    granular data access controls.
  how: >-
    Implementation involves classifying and tagging all data assets, deploying attribute-based
    access control (ABAC) or policy-based access control (PBAC) engines, enforcing encryption
    for data at rest and in transit, implementing data loss prevention (DLP) controls, applying
    micro-segmentation at the data layer, and continuously monitoring and logging all data access
    events. Access decisions incorporate real-time signals including user identity, device health,
    location, time of access, data sensitivity level, and behavioral analytics.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Data Classification"
      value: "Systematic categorization of data by sensitivity level (public, internal, confidential, restricted) to determine appropriate access controls and protection mechanisms."
    - key: "Attribute-Based Access Control"
      value: "Access decisions based on attributes of the user, resource, action, and environment rather than static role assignments, enabling fine-grained and context-aware authorization."
    - key: "Data Encryption Everywhere"
      value: "Mandatory encryption of data at rest, in transit, and in use, ensuring that even if access controls are bypassed, data remains protected from unauthorized disclosure."
    - key: "Continuous Authorization"
      value: "Ongoing evaluation of access permissions throughout a session rather than one-time authentication, revoking access when risk conditions change."
    - key: "Data Loss Prevention"
      value: "Technical controls that monitor, detect, and block unauthorized data transfers or exfiltration attempts based on data classification policies."
    - key: "Micro-Segmentation at Data Layer"
      value: "Isolating data stores and enforcing granular access policies between data segments to prevent lateral movement and limit blast radius of breaches."

    Zero Trust Data Access is a security principle that applies Zero Trust concepts directly to
    data protection and access control. It requires explicit verification of every data access
    request based on real-time context including user identity, device posture, location, data
    sensitivity, and behavioral signals. Rather than relying on network perimeter defenses, this
    principle treats data as the primary asset to protect and enforces access decisions at the
    data layer itself. Key implementation mechanisms include data classification and tagging,
    attribute-based access control (ABAC), mandatory encryption for data at rest and in transit,
    data loss prevention (DLP) controls, micro-segmentation at the data layer, and continuous
    monitoring of all data access events. Defined in NIST SP 800-207 and the CISA Zero Trust
    Maturity Model, Zero Trust Data Access addresses the fundamental limitation of perimeter-based
    security by ensuring that no implicit trust is granted to any entity accessing data resources,
    regardless of their network location or prior authentication status. This principle is essential
    for regulatory compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.
