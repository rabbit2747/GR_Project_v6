# ==== Section 5: Definition ====
definition:
  what: >-
    Security by Design is a software and systems engineering principle that mandates security
    considerations be integrated into every phase of the system development lifecycle (SDLC)
    from requirements gathering through architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, and
    decommissioning. Rather than treating security as an add-on layer, it requires that threat
    modeling, secure coding practices, and security architecture decisions be foundational design
    constraints. The principle is codified in NIST SP 800-160 Volume 1 (Systems Security
    Engineering), operationalized through the OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle, and
    advocated by CISA's Secure by Design initiative. It encompasses secure defaults, defense in
    depth, fail-safe mechanisms, least privilege enforcement, attack surface minimization, and
    separation of duties as core architectural tenets.
  why: >-
    Security vulnerabilities introduced during design and development are exponentially more
    costly to remediate post-deployment. IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report consistently shows
    that organizations with mature secure development practices reduce breach costs by 30-50%.
    Reactive security patching creates perpetual vulnerability windows, while bolt-on security
    controls frequently fail under adversarial pressure. Security by Design reduces the total
    attack surface, minimizes vulnerability density in shipped code, ensures compliance with
    standards such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS, and builds resilient systems that
    withstand evolving threat landscapes. CISA's 2023 Secure by Design guidance elevates this
    from best practice to expected industry standard for technology manufacturers.
  how: >-
    Implementation follows a multi-phase approach: (1) Requirements Phase - define security
    requirements, abuse cases, and compliance constraints alongside functional requirements;
    (2) Design Phase - conduct threat modeling using STRIDE, PASTA, or LINDDUN methodologies,
    establish security architecture patterns, and perform design reviews; (3) Implementation Phase -
    enforce secure coding standards (OWASP Secure Coding Practices, CERT Secure Coding Standards),
    use static application security testing (SAST), and conduct peer code reviews; (4) Testing Phase -
    perform dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing
    (IAST), software composition analysis (SCA), and penetration testing; (5) Deployment Phase -
    harden runtime environments, implement security monitoring, and configure secure defaults;
    (6) Maintenance Phase - establish vulnerability management, patch management, and incident
    response processes integrated into CI/CD pipelines via DevSecOps practices.
  core_concepts:
    - key: "Threat Modeling"
      value: >-
        Structured analysis of potential threats to a system using methodologies such as STRIDE
        (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of
        Privilege) or PASTA to identify and mitigate risks during the design phase.
    - key: "Secure Defaults"
      value: >-
        Systems ship with the most secure configuration as the default state, requiring explicit
        action to reduce security posture. Examples include disabled unnecessary services,
        encrypted communications by default, and minimal privilege assignments.
    - key: "Attack Surface Minimization"
      value: >-
        Systematic reduction of all points where an attacker could attempt to enter or extract
        data, achieved through disabling unused features, closing unnecessary ports, removing
        dead code, and limiting exposed API endpoints.
    - key: "Defense in Depth"
      value: >-
        Layered security architecture where multiple independent security controls protect assets,
        ensuring that the failure of any single control does not compromise the entire system.
        Each layer provides redundant protection against different attack vectors.
    - key: "Fail-Safe Defaults"
      value: >-
        Systems default to a secure state upon failure. Access decisions default to deny,
        error handling does not expose sensitive information, and component failures do not
        cascade into security breaches. Derived from Saltzer and Schroeder's design principles.
    - key: "Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)"
      value: >-
        Integration of security activities into each SDLC phase including security requirements
        analysis, architecture risk analysis, threat modeling, secure code review, security
        testing, and vulnerability management through deployment and operations.

  embedding_text: >-
    Security by Design is a foundational engineering principle requiring that security be embedded
    into every phase of the system development lifecycle rather than applied as a post-hoc measure.
    Codified in NIST SP 800-160 and operationalized through OWASP and CISA guidance, it mandates
    threat modeling during design, secure coding during implementation, comprehensive security
    testing including SAST, DAST, and penetration testing, and secure deployment with hardened
    defaults. Core tenets include secure defaults where systems ship in the most restrictive
    configuration, attack surface minimization through removal of unnecessary functionality,
    defense in depth via layered independent controls, fail-safe defaults that deny access upon
    failure, and least privilege enforcement. The principle traces to Saltzer and Schroeder's
    1975 design principles and has been elevated to an industry expectation by CISA's Secure by
    Design initiative. Implementation follows the Secure Software Development Lifecycle with
    DevSecOps integration for continuous security validation. It enables related principles
    including Defense in Depth, Privacy by Design, and Zero Trust Architecture by establishing
    security as an inherent system property rather than an external addition.
